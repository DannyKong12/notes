#### Types of blood vessels
![Fig. 15.2](../static/BIOL273/fig15.2.png)
1. Artery
2. Artiole
3. Capillary
4. Venule
5. Vein

#### Physics of Flow
* Liquids and gases flow down pressure gradients

#### Influencing Blood Flow
* Myogenic autoregulation (vascular smooth muscle)
  * Stretch receptors in wall of arterioles activates vascoconstriction
* Paracrine hormones
  * released from vascular endothelium
  * Cause vasodilation or casoconstriction
* Innervation by sympathetic division of autonomic nervous system
  * NE binds to alpha receptors and causes
  * E binds to alpha receptors as well, but reinforces vasoconstriction
* Hormonal signals
  * Circulating epinephrine
  * Binds to beta-2 receptors
  * Found only in vascular smooth muscle of heart, liver, and sksletal muscle arterioles
  * causes vasodilation

#### Two components of pressure
1. Kinetic component
  * Result of fluid flow
  * exerted only in direction of flow
1. Static component
  * Hydrostatic pressure
  * Pointed radially

#### Effects on pressure
* Pressure increases when volume decreases
  * Heart generates pressure by contracting
* Pressure is decreased by friction
  * friction resists motion relative between two bodies in contact
  * Between blood and walls of blood vessels

#### Mathematics of flow in a tube
$$\begin{align}
R = \frac{8L\eta}{\pi r^4}
\end{align}$$
* Radius is the most important factor to Resistance

#### Blood pressure
* Arterial blood pressure reflects driving pressure caused by pumping action of heart
* Highest in arteries, lowest at point of return to heart
* Systolic pressure (highest arterial pressure)
* Diastolic (Ventricle relaxation, lowest arterial pressure)
* Mean arterial pressure

#### Blood components
* White blood cells (leukocytes)
  * Immune system functions
  * Move from circulation into parts of body
  * Lymphocytes (B-cell/T-cell)
  * Monocytes (macrophages)
  * Granulocytes
    * Neutrophils
    * Eosinophils
    * Basophils (mast cells)
  * Macrophages & neutrophils
  * NLMEB
* Platelets (thrombocyte)
  * Blood clotting
  * Derived from megakaryocytes
  * Pinch off and have no nucleus


#### Haemoglobin Synthesis
* Required for RBC production
* large complex molecule
* Four protein chains
* Special foetal form different oxygen binding characteristics
