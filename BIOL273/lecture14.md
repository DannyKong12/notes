# Biol 273

#### Primary and Secondary responses
* Secondary responses happen much faster (takes only 24-48 to match)
* Mediated by memory cells

#### 5 Antibody classes
* Ig stands for Immunoglobulin
* IgM - Produced during 1Â° responses and activates complement
* IgA - Found in secretions, neutralizing pathogens before entry
* IgD - Found on surface of B cells with IgM
* IgG - IgG 75% of plasma Ab, 2Â° response Ab activates complments, opsonizes (flagging/tagging)
* IgE - allergic responses, recognized by mast cells

#### Antibody Structure
![Fig. 24.9a](../static/BIOL273/fig24.9a.png)
* Hinge region allows for bending
* Heavy chain
* Two Fab regions
* Two Fc
* Epitope
* Antibodies make up 20% of proteins found in plasma
* Most effective against extracellular pathogens
* Dont damage pathogens themselves

#### Functions of Antibodies
* Opsonizes pathogens for macrophages
* Activate complements
* Activate B lymphocytes
* Antibody Dependent
* Mast cell
* B cells have Abs on their surface as receptors that can bind to Ag directly
* Other cells use Fc receptors which interact with Fc regions of antibodies

#### T Cells
* Need to be in contact directly with target cells
* T Cell Receptor (antigen specific molecule) expressed only as a cell-surface protein
* T cell receptor can't bind free Ag

#### Class I MHC
* Releases perforin (pokes holes in target cell)
* Releases granzymes (enters through holes and triggers apoptosis)


#### Immune response pathways
1. Extracellular bacteria
1. Intracellular viruses
1. Allergic responses
1. Foreign tissue

#### Extracellular Bacteria
![Fig. 24.12](../static/BIOL273/fig24.12.png)
* Breached primary defenses, but not inside cells
* Often inflammatory responses
* Stages of response
1. Complement activated by bacterial cell wall components activate
1. Chemotaxins attract immune leukocytes
1. Some *MAC* attack & lyse bacteria
1. Some opsonize bacteria and help phagocytes digest encapsulated ones
1. Hemostatic events happen
1. Phagocytes produce cytokines and activated lymphocytes present antigens
1. Cytokines secreted by helper T cells activate B cells
1. B cells clonally expand, becoming plasma cells that produce antibodies that act as opsonins and ones that activate complements


#### Intracellular Viruses
![Fig. 24.13](../static/BIOL273/fig24.13.png)
* Viruses must infect a cell to reproduce
* If virus is intracellular, most antibodies and immune cells can no longer interact with viruses themselves
* Infected host cell produces IFN beta and macrophages produces IFB alpha
* Secreted interferons get passed to nearby cells
* Signals to adjacent cells to trigger antiviral activities from class 2 MHC
* Starts antiviral state
* Cytokines secreted from host cells and macrophages activate NKC and Cytotoxic T cells
* Virally infected cell is targeted to be destroyed
* Infected cell undergoes apoptotic and blebs off
* Some viruses turn off MHC class I
* NK cells kill any cell with no MHC I
* End of response most Cytotoxic cells die, but some become memory cells


#### Allergies
* Inflammatory response triggered by specific antigens
* Overreaction of immune system
* Can be mediated by antibodies or T cells (immediate, delayed)
* Sensitization phase, equivalent to primary immune response to non-harmful allergen
* Antigen (allergen) ingested by APC and activates a helper T cell
* Helper T cell recognizes particular allergen
* Helper T cell clone releases cytokines activating B cells
* Naive B lymphocytes gets activated and clonally expand
* Plasma cells produce antibodies, and becomes memory cells
* Re-exposure to allergen results in inflammatory response as a secondary response
* IgE class antibodies
* Mast cells that are sensitive to allergens degranulate and releases cytokines/histamines
* Localized responses (rashes, hay fever)
* Systemic response (anaphylactic shock)
    * Vasodilation, circulatory collapse
    * Bronchoconstriction

#### Foreign Tissue
* If recipient and doner share the same HLA, tissue is transplanted successfully
* Common example of tissue donation is blood transfusion
* RBCs do not contain MHC proteins found on nucleated cells
* Contain other proteins (groups of Ags)
* Leads to blood types, A, B, AB, O
* As well as antibodies to RBCs that they do not possess
* e.g. Type A will have anti B
* Requires blood from donor that reacts with antibodies
* Antibodies causes blood to agglutinate (clump)
* Ab binding also activates complement cascade
* MAC attack -> cells lyse -> Hb released
* kidneys trap free Hb -> renal failure
