#### Steps of an Immune Response
* When pathogens overcome the defence system of the body
* Same basic steps regardless of the foreign substance
  1. Detection and Identification
  1. Communication with other immune cells
  1. Recruitment of help and coordination of Response
  1. Destruction of suppresion of the invader
* Immune system uses chemical signalling
    * Antibodies bind to antigens as a signal
    * Cytokines affect growth and activity of other cells

#### Two main categories of immunity
* Innate and acquired (adaptive, specific) immunity that overlap and cooperate in mounting responses to pathogens
* Response time is different for innate and acquired immunity
* Innate response is faster, with less specificity
* Innate responses can lead to acquired responses
* Acquired responses are slower with more specificity
1. Innate immunity
    * present before pathogen is encountered and is non-specific to the pathogen
    * Response begins within minutes to hours and does not remember past infections by pathogen
    * Some non-specific cell types and proteins
    * Inflammation is distinctive in innate immune response
    * All organisms have this
2. Acquired immunity
    * Develops after the pathogen is encountered and following response takes days to weeks
    * Remembers past infections and response faster after the first time
    * two types:
        1. cell-mediated
        1. Humoral (antibodies)
    * only found in vertebrates
