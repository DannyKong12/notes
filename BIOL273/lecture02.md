#### More on Glial cells
  * Schwann cells wrap around axons in layers of myelin
  * Satellite cells support cell bodies

#### CNS Glial cells
![Fig 8.5c](../static/BIOL273/fig8.5c.png)
  * Oligodendrocytes are CNS version of schwann cells
    * Also wraps around axons of CNS interneurons
    * Has multiple branching (vs single branch in PNS)
  * Astroglia/Astrocytes
    * branched in star shaped process
    * supporting structure for interneurons
    * maintain neuron microenvironment and help maintain homeostasis in extracellular fluid
    * also cover capillaries
  * Mircoglia
    * Small, specialized immune cells
    * removes damaged cells and foreign invaders
    * scavenging macrophages
![Fig 8.5b](../static/BIOL273/fig8.5b.png)
  * Ependymal cells
    * produces cerebral spinal fluids
    * Create selectively permeable barrier between compartments in brain
    * Are epithelial cells

#### Electrical Signals
  * Cell membrane is a good electrical insulator
  * Current conduction only through ion channels
  * Neurons need to use changes in previously set up electrochemical gradients

#### Osmotic principles
  * Molecules move down their gradients
  * Osmotic pressure + electrochemical gradient
  * Semi-permeability (ions and other polar hydrophilic molecules)
  * Recall from [Biol130](../Biol\ 130/BIOL130_LEC_11.md)

#### Prediction of Ion Movement
  * chemical/physical properties (concentration, charge of ion, etc)
  * Ions can move into, out of, no net movement
  * Can calculate cell electrical potential
  * Nernst Equation:
$$E_{ion} = \frac{61}{z}\log_{10}\frac{[\text{ion}]_{out}}{[\text{ion}]_{in}}$$
  * Nernst equation is important for prediction net Ion movement

#### Membrane Potential
  * At rest, inside of the cell is electronegative due to free negative ions
  * Relative potentials are set up by relative concentrations
  * Nernst equation can only be used for one ion at a time
  * Positive equilibrium potential move inwards, Negative outwards
  * Charge of cell at rest (steady state, not sending signal) is called resting membrane potential

#### Influencing Membrane Potential
  * At rest: $Na^+$, $Cl^-$, $Ca^{2+}$ higher in ECF, $K^+$ higher in ICF
  * Membrane permeability contributes to resting membrane potential
  * Some channels are "leaky" eg cannot be closed, $K$, $Na$
  * Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation takes membrane permeability of each ion

#### Regulated Ion Movement
  * Sodium-Potassium pump used to set up gradients across membrane, sets up resting membrane potential
  * Other gated channels (mechanical, chemically, voltage)
  * Changes from the resting potential produces electrical signals

#### Transmission of Electrical Signals
  * Neurons use stored energy in electrical and chemical gradients to transmit electrical signals
  * Depolarization -> decrease in potential difference
  * Hyperpolarization -> increase in potential difference (more negative)
  * Repolarization -> return to rest
