#### Influence heart rate
* Autonomic system
* Epinephrine increases bpm
* Parasympathetic decreases

#### Other chemicals stimulate the heart
* Herbal supplements â€” ephedrine, ma huang
* Ephedrine like alkaloids, amphetamine

#### Coordination of contraction
* 1% involved in electrical excitation of the heart
* Initiate heart beat
* Spread rapidly through heart by gap junctions (within intercalated disks)

#### Conducting system pathway
![Fig. 14.14](../static/BIOL273/fig14.14.png)
* System sends the signal through pathway, but also through contractile cells
* SA Pacemaker cells
  * Sets the whole pathway
  * Spreads signal to internodal (between SA and AV nodes) pathway
* Internodal pathway
  * Connects the two nodes in the floor of the right atrium
* Atrio-ventricular nodes
  * Bundle of His
* Divides into left and right bundle branches
* Divides into Purkinje Fibres
* Spreads out to the ventricular contractile cells

#### Events in conduction of an AP
1. Action potential fired from SA nodes
1. Spreads to adjacent cells via gap junctions
1. Rapid spread through cells of internodal pathway
  * Spread is slower through contractile cells of atrium
  * Actin, myosin, etc. provide resistance
1. Signal is passed through AV node only at AV junction to layer of fibrous material acts as insulator prevents electrical signals from atrium to ventricle
1. Signal is slightly delayed by AV node
  * Ensures atria have time to contract
1. Signal is carried to bottom of the heart (apex)
  * Conduction through AV node ensures signal is coordinated

#### Abnormal heart rhythms
* Heartbeat can be started by almost all heart tissue
* Fastest pacemaker cells (in the SA node) sets heart rate
* Ectopic beat when started by other parts of the heart

#### Bradycardia
* Slow heartbeat -> less than 60BPM
* Symptoms fatigue, dizziness, lightheadedness

#### Tachycardia
* More than 100 bpm

#### Disorganized contraction
* Ventricular fibrillation
  * Disorganized contraction
  * Collapse and sudden death results
  * Attemp to re-coordinate contraction with electrical shock
* Atrial fibrillation
  * Atrial quivers
  * Blood isn't pumped out completely when heart beats
  * Blood is allowed to pool and clot and lodges in arteries or brain


#### Components of ECG
* Waves
  * Deflections above or below the baseline
  * Electrical events
  * 3 Major Waves:
    - P wave
    - QRS complex
    - T wave
