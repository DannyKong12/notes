# Biol 273

#### Smooth muscle
* Found in walls of hollow organs and tubes
* Not attached to skeleton (compare to skeletal muscle)
* Much fewer in terms of % of body weight
* Some important smooth muscles
  * Bladder sphincter
  * intestine
  * walls of blood vessels

#### Smooth muscle is hard to study
* Many types of smooth muscle throughout animals (hard to do research bc lack of model organisms)
* Fibre arrangment is not linear but in many directions
* Electrical properties make direct stimulation difficult, most are hormone controlled
* Conflicting stimuli (smooth muscle in different locations respond differently to same stimuli)

#### Arrangement of smooth muscle cells
![Fig. 12.23](../static/BIOL273/fig12.23.png)
1. Single unit
  * Cells coupled by gap junctions
  * Not necessary to electrically stimulate each individual fibre
  * Found on walls of internal organs
    * e.g. intestine, blood vessels
  * Innervated by autonomic pathway
  * Autonomic neurons form varicosities
  * Action potential releases synaptic vesicles from varicosities
  * Innervation of a single layer of smooth muscle starts pathway inside smooth muscle cells
2. Multi-unit
  * **No gap junctions**
  * Each individual muscle fibre is separately innervated
    * Iris and ciliary body of eye, parts of reproductive organs
  * Varicosities interlaced throughout smooth muscle, each cell is stimulated individually

#### Notes
  * Uterine smooth muscle is multi-unit
  * Prior to labour, smooth muscle undergo remodelling, and form gap junctions
  * Allows for synchronization of electrical signals

#### Skeletal vs Smooth muscle
  * Whole muscle level
    * Contraction changes shape of muscle, not just the length
    * Develops tension slowly
    * Maintain contraction longer without fatiguing
    * In terms of tension vs force, smooth muscle has the slowest (most gradual) contraction-relaxation
  * Cellular level
    * Cells are much smaller than skeletal muscle
    * Smooth muscle are shorter and smaller, about the smae diameter of a myofibril
    * Actin and myosin not arranged in sarcomeres (no striations)
    * Actin and myosin in smooth muscle arranged in long bundles diagonally around periphery
    * Fig 12.25a
    * Actin and myosin arranged between dense bodies which are supported by intermediate filament
    * No T-tubules in sarcolemma, no SR
    * Caveolae (analogous to terminal cisternae in skeletal muscle) calcium storage site
    * *Amount* of calcium release impacts contraction force
    * Effect of not having T-tubules
      * No direct coupling between AP to Calcium release through DHP receptor and ryanodine receptor coupling
      * Calcium entering through cell membrane
  * Molecular level
    * Myosin ATPase activity is slower
    * Myosin heads are all along thick filaments, not just at the ends
    * No troponin (tropomyosin is still expressed)
    * Longer actin and myosin
    * Smooth muscle can be stretched and still develop contraction

#### Smooth muscle contraction regulation
![Fig. 12.26a](../static/BIOL273/fig12.26a.png)
  * Major difference is the role of phosphorylation
    * As opposed to troponin inhibiting contraction
  1. Increase in calcium levels initiates contraction
    * Cytosolic calcium control contraction
    * Recall: calcium released from ECF
  1. Something I missed, probably calcium stuff
  1. Entry results in release of SR and from caveolae
    * Calcium dependent (induced) calcium release
  1. Calcium binds to calmodulin
  1. Activates myosin light chain kinase (phosphorylates myosin light chain)
    * When myosin head is *not* phosphorylated, ATPase activity is inhibited
    * When myosin is activated by MLCK
    * ATP activates MLCK and phosphorylates myosin ATPase
  1. Allows crossbridge cycling and crossbridge cycling
    * same crossbridge cycling process as skeletal muscle
  * Notes:
    * In smooth muscle the myosin is regulated via phosphorylation of myosin
      * compare to actin regulation via troponin/tropomyosin

#### Smooth muscle relaxation
  * Calcium is removed from cytosol
  * Calcium and Calmodulin activity decreases
  * myosin light chain phosphatase
