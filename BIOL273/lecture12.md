## Immune System
#### Function of the Immune System
* Large multicellular organisms provide lots of environments for other smaller organisms
* ability of the body to fight off invaders is called immunity
* Key features of the immune system
    * Lymphoid tissues and immune cells
    * Chemicals produced by cells that coordinate and execute function
* Three major functions of the immune System
1. Protecting the body potentially pathogenic compounds like:
    * Microbes: bacterial, viral, fungal, protozoal
    * Parasites: worms, ticks, etc
    * Toxins produced by microbes
    * Foreign proteins or substances like allergens
2. Removes dead/damaged tissue and cells
    * Immune cells scavenge extracellular compartments
    * Microglia :(
3. Tries to recognize and remove abnormal cells
    * Cells from the host body that may have mutations
    * Cells that are unable to control growth may be detected by the immune system
    * Generally difficult for the body to detect

#### Diseases of the immune system
* When immune system doesn't perform normally, you can get a variety of pathologies
1. Incorrect responses (autoimmunity)
1. Overactive response (allergies)
1. Lack of response (immunodeficiency)

#### Types of pathogens

|Parasites|Bacteria|Viruses|
|:--|:--|:--|
|generally Extracellular|Can be intracellular *or* extracellular|Not cells, composed of nucleic acid and a protein coat, can only be intracellular|
|Enter body via a variety of routes|Can survive and reproduce in body|Parasitic and requires host cell to reproduce|
|Causes chronic illness, nutritional deficiencies, or death|Susceptible to antibiotics|May rupture host cell or bud off in vesicles|
|||Cannot be killed by antibiotics, but may be treated by antiviral drugs|

#### Anatomy of the Immune System
* Immune system organs are called lymphoid organs, lymphocytes are found there
* Lymphoid organs are connected by blood vessels and lymph vessels
  * Carry lymph (ECF that has left capillaries & filter through tissue)
  * Lymph is a conduit for immunologically active cells to travel through
  * Network of vasculature composed of both blood and lymph vessels that immunologically active cells travel through
  * Lymph nodes are located at strategic positions (knee, groin, elbow, shoulder, neck)
  ![Fig. 24.3](../static/BIOL273/fig24.3.png)
  * Small bean-like nodes
  * Regions of the body outside lymphoid organs -> called the periphery
  * Immune cells may exit the lymphoid organs into the periphery and come back
* Arterioles lead into capillary beds, which have movement of fluid from blood plasma to ECF
* Interstitial fluid has a slightly net movement outward from capillaries
* Lymphatic vessels carry leftover interstitial fluid and becomes lymph
* Lymphatic fluid is not a driven fluid
* Eventually enters venous circulation, recycled into plasma

#### Types of lymphoid organs
1. Primary
    * Organs where lymphocytes develop
    * Bone marrow (production of all types of blood cells through hematopoiesis, B-cells maturation site)
    * Thymus (T-cells mature here after being produced at bone marrow) -- Located in the top of the chest
2. Secondary
    - Organs where lymphocytes interact and initiate responses
      * Spleen, lymph nodes, tonsils, gut associated lymphoid tissue (GALT)
      * Tonsils and GALT are diffuse tissues
      * Lymph nodes and spleen are encapsulated
    - Filter blood & lymph for pathogens and pathogen containing lymphocytes
    - Structure of secondary lymphoid organs reflect function:
      * Afferent lymph vessel brings in lymphocytes from periphery
      * Center of lymph node is called the pulp
      * Immune system cells are found in the pulp, and filters blood brought into lymph node
      * Efferent lymph vessel allows them to keep circulating
    - Lymph nodes that are very active can swell and expand against the fibrous walls

#### Types of Leukocytes
* Leukocytes are main players in the immune system
* Larger than RBC but much less numerous (7000 count per ml vs 5,000,000 RBC)
* Can leave blood stream and function extravascularly
* Various lifespan, some alive for a few hours to several months
![Fig. 24.5](../static/BIOL273/fig24.5.png)
* 6 main types
      * Eosinophils
      * Basophils (Mast cells)
      * Neutrophils
      * Monocytes (macrophages)
      * Lymphocytes
      * Dendritic cells
* Functional/Morphological groups
  1. Granulocytes (morphological classification)
      * Prominent cytoplasmic granules
      * Basophils, Neutrophils, Eosinophils
  1. Phagocytes (functional classification)
      * Can undergo phagocytosis, engulfing and ingesting pathogens
      * Neutrophils, Eosinophils, Monocytes, Macrophages
      * Eosinophils only undergo phagocytosis ex vivo
  1. Cytotoxic cells (functional group)
      * Can kill other cells including host cells
      * Eosinophils, certain lymphocytes
      * Cytotoxic T cells, Natural killer cells
  1. Antigen presenting cells (morphological group)
      * Display fragments of pathogens on their cell surface
      * Certain B cells, dendritic cells, macrophages

#### Antigens and Antibodies
* Antigen (Ag) A substance that are recognized by an antibody and induces an immune response
* Antibodies (Ab) proteins that bind specifically to certain Ag's and target pathogens for destructions
* Antibodies are produced by B cells

#### Eosinophils: Cytotoxic Granulocytes
* Characterized by pink staining granules
* Function in allergic and parasite responses
* Very few in peripheral circulation
* Lifespan 6-12
* Binds to antibodies and degranulate

#### Basophils: Granulocytes in allergies
* Basophils live in blood in very rare numbers, Mast cells live in tissue (digestive tract, lungs, skin)
* Granules contain histamine, heparin, cytokines

#### Neutrophils: Phagocytic Granulocytes
* Most abundant leukocyte 50-70%
* Live 1-2 days and engulf bacteria
* Can function extravascularly
* Granules contain cytokines that cause fever to start other responses

#### Monocyte: Precursor to tissue macrophages
* Uncommon in blood, more useful in tissues
* In blood for 8 hours, then mature into macrophages when they move into tissue
* Large amebaloid
* Phagocytose up to 100 bacteria
* APCs, present antigens of digested bacteria

#### Lymphocytes
* Key players in acquired immune responses
* Make up large part of all leukocytes, many can be found at any given time
* Morphologically identical (eg between B and T cells)

#### Dendritic Cells
* Have long thin processes, like dendrites on neurons
* Found in skin and other organs
* Recognize and engulf pathogens

#### :b: cells
* Produced in bone marrow
* Called B cells because they develop in Bursa of Fabricius

#### T Lymphocytes (T cells)
![Fig. 24.11](../static/BIOL273/fig24.11.png)
* Produced in the bone marrow, and migrate to the thymus where they mature
* Thymus is most active during childhood
* T-cell receptor are only able to recognize specific antigens via MHC-antigen complex
* T-cells cannot recognize a free antigen

#### MHC
* MHC stands for major histocompatibility complex
* Display self antigens and non-self antigens
* Name is derived from role of MHCs in transplant rejection
* Large # of alleles in the population

#### Two types of T cells
1. Helper T cells
2. Cytotoxic T cells
