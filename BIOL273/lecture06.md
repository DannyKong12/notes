#### Cardiac Muscle
![Fig. 14.8](../static/BIOL273/fig14.8.png)
* Cardiac muscle cells are called myocardial cells
  * Specialized muscle cells of the heart
* Shares features with both smooth and skeletal muscles
* Most myocardial cells are typical striated muscle
  * Contractile fibres organized into sarcomeres
* Cardiac muscle differes from skeletal muscle
  * Cardiac muscle cells are much smaller
  * Have one single nucleus
  * Branched appearance
  * About 1/3 of cell volume is occupied by mitochondria
  * T-tubules are much larger, branched
  * SR is smaller
  * Adjacent cells joined by intercalated disks with desmosomes
  * Intercalated disks interdigitates between two muscle cells
  * Gap junctions allow movement of Calcium
* About 1% of cardiac cells are not involved in contraction
  ![Fig. 14.14](../static/BIOL273/fig14.14.png)
  * Involved in electrical excitation of the heart -> conducting system
  * Autorhythmic/pacemaker cells
  * Initiate heartbeat
  * Allow it to spread rapidly throughout heart
  * Connected to other cardiac cells via gap junctions

#### Cardiac muscle contraction
* Similar to sksletal muscle, except
  * Calcium enteres through calcium channels as well as through the SR
  * SR provides 90% of calcium for contraction, but 10% from outside is necessary
  * Calcium-induced-calcium-release
![Fig. 14.9](../static/BIOL273/fig14.9.png)
  * Action potential enteres from adjacent cell
  * Voltage gated calcium opens
  * Calcium induced calcium release
  * Calcium binds with troponin
* Cardiac muscle contraction
  * Cardiac muscles have Sodium Calcium antiport
  * Removes calcium into extracellular space and SR
* Cardiac muscles display graded contraction
  * Force generated proportional to the number of active crossbridges
  * \# of active crossbridges is proportional to cytosolic calcium
  * Force is also proportional to cytosolic calcium

#### Factors for contraction
* Regulated by epinephrine and norepinephrine
* Neurotransmitters bind to and acivate $\beta_1$-adrenergic receptors
* Recall: $\beta_1$ respond equally to epinephrine and norepinephrine
* $\beta_1$ activate cAMP secondary messenger
* Leads to phosphorylation of voltage gated Ca channels
* Increases open probability leads to Calcium concentration
* Also induces the phosphorylation of phospholamban
* Phospholamban increases activity of SR Calcium ATPase
* Leads to increase of SR Calcium
* e.g. Increases force but shorter duration

#### Cardiac contractile cell action potential
1. Open Na channels
1. Open fast K channels and allows initial repolarization
1. Calcium channels slowly open and gradually repolarize
1. Slow K channels open, Calcium channels close (full repolarization)

#### Unique factors of Cardiac AP
* Sustained depolarization
* Different ions - Cardiac muscles have changes to calcium permeability
* Skeletal muscle develops tetanus
* Longer cardiac AP repolarization period stops tetanus

## Unit 4 Cardiovascular system
#### Role of the cardiovascular system
* The problem with being multi-cellular
* Require from the environment:
  * Nutrients and oxygen
* Rate of diffusion of oxygen and nutrients is limited by distance
* Overcome this diffusion limitation by:
  * bulk flow through cardiovascular system for transport
  * Transported by flow of blood through circulatory system
*
