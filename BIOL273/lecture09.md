#### Haemoglobin-Oxygen Saturation
* Curve is S-shaped (logistic)
* Resting cell at ~40 PO2 ~75% saturation (moderate saturation)
* Alveoli at 100 PO2, ~95% saturation (high saturation)
* Different forms of haemoglobin have slightly different dissociation curves
* Increases in temperature decreases binding affinity to Oxygen
* Increases in CO2 and H+ decrease haemoglobin oxygen affinity
* Closer to neutral decreases haemoglobin affinity

#### Tissue vs. Lungs
* In tissue:
  * Higher temperature, PCO2, H+
  * Increases dissociation and unloads Oxygen

#### Haematopoiesis
* All blood cells are produced in bone marrow
* Arise from a single precursor -> pluripotent haematopoietic stem cell
* Cells develop through a series of stages
* Pluripotent hematopoietic -> uncommitted stem cells -> Committed progenitor cells
* Get signalling from cytokines, produces various cells in bone barrow
* Becomes fully differentiated cells in circulation
NLMEB
(Neutrophil, Lymphocyte, Macrophages, Eosinophil, Basophil, Erythrocytes)

#### Cytokines
* Small peptides, proteins secreted by one cell to send signals to another
* Called factors (growth factor, modifying factor)
* Colony-stimulating factors -> stimulate growth of leukocytes
* Interleukins -> cytokines released by one WBC to act on another WBC (act between WBCs)
* Thrombopoietin -> regulates the growth and production of megakaryocytes
* Erythropoetin -> regulates growth of erythrocytes

#### Leukopoiesis
* Formation of leukocytes
* Regulated by the colony-stimulating factors
* Released by endothelial cells, marrow fibroblasts, and WBCs
* Induce cell division and cell maturation in stem cells
* Cytokines released by leukocytes regulate further leukocyte production
* Disorders of leukopoiesis, e.g. leukemia and neutropenia

* Stroma is composed of fibroblast like cells
* Marrow is permeated by capillaries, lined with endothelial cells
* Hematopoiesis occurs in active stromal region of bone marrow
* Stroma is a good environment for stem cells

#### Megakaryocyte
* megakaryocytes are parent cells that produce platelets
* Growth and maturation is regulated by thrombopoietin
* Undergo mitosis up to 7x without undergoing nuclear or cytoplasmic division
* Does undergo duplication of DNA (big cell with multiple copies of DNA)
* Polyploid cell with lobed nucleus (not spherical nucleus)
* Megakaryocyte fragments break off into capillaries
* Megakaryocyte itself stays inside bone marrow
* Lifespan of 10 days

#### Platelets
* Always present in cells, dormant
* Can be activated when damage occurs to circulatory system walls

#### Haematostasis
* Opposite to haematostasis is haemorrhage
* Vital to maintain integrity of blood vessels

* Platelets is exposed to collagen which is subendothelial layer
* Platelets are activated by collagen
* Burst open platelets release platelet factors to attract more platelets
* Aggregates into a platelet plug
![Fig. 16.10](../static/BIOL273/fig16.10.png)
* Blood clots are result of coagulation cascade

#### Intrinsic pathway
* Tissue factor XII:
  * Present in plasma as inactive protein
  * Activates factor XI
* Tissue factor XI:
  * Activates IX

#### Extrinsic pathway
* Tissue factor III Activates VII

#### Common pathway
* Both pathways leads to active Factor X
* Factor X activates Prothrombin
* Prothrombin activates Thrombin
* Thrombin cuts fibrinogen into fibrin
* Fibrin forms a mesh, Factor XIII helps cross-link the fibrin
* Interwined fibres reinforce the platelet plug making it a clot
* Excessive clots form a thrombus, loose thrombus forms an embolus


#### Functions of respiratory system
* Multicellular organism need a specialized respiratory organ

#### Four Main Processes
![Fig. 17.1](../static/BIOL273/fig17.1.png)
1. Gas exchange between body and atmosphere (ventilation)
  * Air moves into lungs and out of lungs
  * inspiration (inhalation) expiration (exhalation)
  * Follows tidal ventilation (follows same path in and out)
1. Gas exchange between lungs and blood
  * Occurs in alveoli
1. Transport of gases by blood
1. Exchange of gases between blood and tissue

A. Conducting System
B. Exchange surface
C. Pumping system
