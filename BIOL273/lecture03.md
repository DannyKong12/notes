## Unit 2

#### Receptors in the target tissue
* Different receptors on different target tissues is critical for the response

#### Adrenergic receptors
* $\alpha_1$ receptors -> found on most tissues -> NE>E
* $\beta_1$ -> heart muscle and kidney -> NE=E
* $\beta_2$ -> blood vessels, smooth muscle -> E>NE
* Receptors act via G-proteins
* $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$ stimulate cAMP production
* $\alpha_1$ increases $Ca^{2+}$ production


#### Cholinergic Receptors
* Nicontinic and muscarinic
* Named after nicontine and muscarine agonists

#### Nicontinic Receptors
* Found on sympathetic and parasympathetic ganglia, and muscle motor end plates
* Act on ion channels ($Na^+$)
* Always excitatory

#### Muscarinic Receotprs
* Found on target tissues on **parasympathetic**
* Are coupled with G-proteins which may open ion channels
* can be both excitatory and inhibitory

#### Pathways and Receptors
* Sympathetic and Parasympathetic receptors different neurotransmitters
* Sympathetic -> NE
* Parasympathetic -> ACh

#### Neuroendocrine Tissue
* Adrenal medulla is associated with the sympathetic division
![Fig. 11.8](../static/BIOL273/fig11.8.png)
* Adrenal gland has two parts:
  * Adrenal cortex -> secretes steroid hormones (endocrine)
  * Adrenal medulla -> secretes epinephrine into blood (neuroendocrine)
* Chromaffin cells release epinephrine
  * similar to sympathetic pathway
  * Pre-ganglionic neuron release ACh to chromaffin
  * Chromaffin epinephrine enters bloodstream

#### Somatic Division
* Causes msucle excitation

#### Neuromuscular Junction
![Fig. 11.9](../static/BIOL273/fig11.9.png)
* Synapse of a somatic motor neuron on a skeletal muscle fibre
* Schwann cell sheath at the bouton thing
* 3 main components:
  1. Presynaptic axon termina
      - filled with ACh vesicles
  1. Muscle motor end plate
  1. Post-synaptic membrane of skeletal muscle
      - nicontinic receptors
      - highly folded to increase receptors
* Nicotinic receptors allows both ions to move across and rapidly depolarizes cell


#### Muscles (Skeletalmuscle)
* 2 main functions
  * motion
  * force
* Can only contract, not expand
* Generates heat and contributes to temperature homeostasis
* muscle fibres are long cylindrical cells
* myoblast as precursor cells of muscle, retains nuclei
* Striations

#### Smooth muscle
* Primary muscle of internal organs and tubes (e.g. stomach, blood)

#### Cardiac
* Found only in the heart
* Branched structure
* Neighbouring cells interact through intercalated disk
* Striated muscle

#### Muscle structure
![Fig. 12.3a](../static/BIOL273/fig12.3a.png)
* Enclosed completely by epimysium connective tissue sheet
* Bundles of muscle fibres called fasicles
* Bundles (fasicles) surrounded by perimysium
* Connective tissue sheet surrounding muscle cell (endomysium)
* Contains many
* Sarcoplasmic reticulum
