#### Parametric Curves
  * We used to define curves as only using something of the form $y=f(x)$
  * We used to also define vector functions with the form $\vec{V}=\vec{V_0}+\vec{V}t$
  * We can use this form to define scalar functions with the components of V as functions of t

#### Evaluating parametric functions
  * If possible, write as $y=f(x)$ by eliminating t if possible
  * Make a table of values
  * plot $x(t)$ and $y(t)$ separately
  * Parametric curves have direction
  * Still a vector function, so moves towards increasing t

__Ex1:__ $x=2-t, y=t+1$
$$\begin{align}
t &= 2-x \\
y &= 2-x+1 \\
y &= 3-x
\end{align}$$

__Ex2:__ $x=\frac{1}{t}, y=t-1$
$$\begin{align}
t &= \frac{1}{x} \\
y &= \frac{1}{x}-1 \\
\end{align}$$
