#### Foundational Physics in 2020
We have, at this moment, two descriptions of physics that have not been reconciled

Quantum Theory, including:
* Wave-particle Duality
* Tunneling
* Entanglement
* Teleportation
* Atomic Structure
* Bose-Einstein Condensation
* Superconductivity
* Anomalous magnetic moments
* Asymptotic Freedom
* Neutrino Oscillations

General relativity, including:
* Special Relativity
* Precession of Mercury

#### Quantum Entanglement
We can come up with a simple description of quantum entanglement with coins. A classical coin can flip heads/tails, but a quantum coin could be in a superposition. Entanglement comes up when we have two coins, there exists a quantum state of two coins where when we observe one coin flip, we only see heads on one coin and tails on the other, or vice versa. Once we measure one coin, we "know" the state of the other.

Remember though that quantum events are observed in nature. Ultraviolet light shined on Beta-barium borate, entanglement occurs in the polarization of the scattered photons

#### Relativity

To explain black holes, we have to first briefly talk about GR. Gravity in GR is not a force in the normal sense but is really a curvature of spacetime. Instead of an observer accelerating towards a gravitational mass (such as the earth), we say that the observer is moving inertially in spacetime, but the Earth is in their future. 

#### Black holes

We know that when we throw an object it falls back down. We can throw it faster, and it would still come down although much slower. We can do a small thought experiment. It must be possible to throw an object so fast that it takes infinite time to come back down, the escape velocity.

John Michell thought about this problem, and calculated mass (and radius) of a star like object that had an escape velocity of $c$, what we know today as a black hole. At the time, Laplace argued that since light is massless (and therefore not affected by gravity), the equation must not hold.

Einstein poses the Einstein field equations, and Schwartzchild solves them. Inside this equation gives us the same term for $r_H$ that Michell solved for. It turned out later that Schwarzschild's solution describes a Black Hole. GR has evidence, see precession of Mercury and bending of light due to gravity.

John Michell originally suggests that a black hole is a region of space for which the escape velocity is greater than the speed of light, i.e. it traps the light (and everything else)

Properties of Black Holes
* Nothing can stop black holes from forming (Penrose)
* One way flow of information (maybe?)

#### Tunneling out of a Black Hole
Tunneling is an event in which waves with less energy than is required to overcome a barrier, can still "tunnel" through it.  Through tunneling, particles can manifest out of nothing, even though there isn't enough energy. HEP experiements show examples of this happening.

Its possible for a black to capture one particular particle out of the pair, but not the other. A black hole radiates energy through this mechanism (assuming conservation of energy). Not only does it radiate energy. Through radiation, the mass gets smaller, and the radiation increases. It is not known what happens when a black hole fully evaporates. 

#### Entanglement in Quantum Fields

Fields couples with fields through entanglement. For example, the electromagnetic field couples with electrons. One photon is emitted when the electron drops, and absorbs one when it jumps up.

More importantly, due to Fulling-Dennis-Unruh, we see that there is entanglement all around us. In fact, across the boundary between any partition in spacetime, we have a significant amount of entanglement in the particles straddling the partition. 

#### Quantum Detectors

Unruh de Witt detectors. A single detector that acceleratres with constant acceleration will respond as though it is in the heat bath. This happens also in finite time acceleration, with motion within a cavity. The effect is the same, an acceleration observer sees a hot universe, and a non-accelerating observer sees a cold one.

Combining two detectors in a maximally entangled state, we can accelerate one of the two, but it degrades entanglement. The more acceleration, the less entanglement. 

Gravity is the same as entanglement (locally at least). Gravity seems to affect quantum entanglement. A single detector cannot know the difference between a heat bath and an expanding universe of the same temperature (Hawking and Gibbons). Ver Steeg and Menicucci actually shows that two detectors can. 

#### Entanglement Harvesting
Static detectors: 
* The entanglement goes down the farther apart they are
* The entanglement goes up with increasing energy gap
* Can extract entanglement even if they are spacelike separated

#### Entanglement and Equivalence
Inside a spherical shell, the gravity is zero. We can tell with entanglement harvesting whether or not you are in flat space or simply in a spherical shell. You can even tell if the spherical shell is rotating.

#### Harvesting Entanglement and Black Holes
Two detectors in an AdS space. (Henderson Hennigar RGM Smith Zhang CQG 35 2018). Experiments casts a shadow of the entanglement of the black hole. 

#### Anti-Hawking Effect
We know that black holes radiate heat. Certain black holes of tiny mass has an effect on these detectors

#### Information And Black Holes
Recap: Steven Hawking's Hawking radiation seems to show that quantum information can be irreversibly destroyed. 

As an example, we have the quantum erasure channel, which takes a number of qubits and with some probability erases the qubit (replacing it with some placeholder symbol $\epsilon$, or even wlog the $|0\rangle$ state). However, even this channel has a Stinespring dilation which is a unitary representation on a larger space, which is still reversible. Albeit possibly practically impossible, theoretically it is possible to recover the state.

Suppose we take a quantum state that is many qubits, but we let it collapse gravitationally into a black hole. Hawking says this black hole eventually evaporates, and although we don't fully know what happens, it would appear that the black hole just disappears, leaving no information of what went inside.
