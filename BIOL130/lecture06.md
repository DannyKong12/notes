#### Energy
  * How do cells acquire energy

#### Cellular Respiration
  * Most important source of glucose is from carbohydrates (sugar)
  * Activated carrier molecules
  * Two metabolic pathways
  * Catabolism
    * food molecules undergo favourable exergonic reactions
    * releases energy into activated carrier molecules
  * Anabolism
    * Released energy from activated carrier molecules go into complex reactions
    * endergonic reactions driven by carrier molecule energy
  * Macromolecule synthesis requires energy
    * nucleic acids require ATP specifically to make bonds

| activated carrier | group carried in high-energy linkage |
---|---
ATP | phosphate
NADH NADPH FADH2 | electrons and hydrogens
Acetyl CoA | acetyl group
Carboxylated biotin | carboxyl group
S-adenosylmethionine | methyl group
Uridine diphosphate glucose | glucose

#### ATP
  * Adenine-Ribose-Phosphates
  * phosphoanhydride bonds
  * third bond is very high energy
  * breaking that bond releases large amounts of energy

#### Oxidation of glucose
  * $C_6H_{12}O_2 + 6O_2 \rightarrow 6CO_2 + 6H_2O + energy$
  * Stepwise oxidation of glucose vs directly burning sugar
  * Reduces overall reaction into small steps with small activation energies feasible at body temperature
  * Smaller reactions => smaller $\Delta$G
  * __total energy change is the same__
  * Free energy change per step is small, corresponding to small energy carriers being synthesized

#### How do we make ATP
  1. Substrate level phosphorylation  
    Only functions with -$\Delta$G bond breaking
  2. Oxidative phosphorylation  
    Proton pumps change $H^+$ concentrations in the environment causing $NAD^+$ to change to $NADH$
  3. Photophosphorylation is the use of photosynthesis  
    Cyclic/non-cyclic

#### Extracting energy from food
  1. Digestion
  1. Glycolysis
  1. TCA and Oxidative phosphorylation

#### Steps in Cellular Respiration
  1. Glycolysis
  1. Pyruvate thing
  1. TCA cycle

#### Some notes on redox
  * Must occur in pairs

#### Aerobic processes
  * required for greater energy yield in respiration
  * Cristae

#### Citric acid/TCA cycle
  * Start with two carbon acyl groups
  * builds a citrate with oxaloacetate
  * Slowly oxidizes back into oxaloacetate
  * produces two $CO_2$ one GTP, $FADH_2$ 3 $NADH$ twice per pyruvate

#### Rest of the reaction is an oxidative phosphorylation
  * Occurs in the ETC
  * $NADH$ is used to produce a high concentration gradient in the inner membrane space
  * NADH donates high energy electrons to the first enzyme
  * lowers energy of the electron as H+ is pumped out
  * H2O is produced
