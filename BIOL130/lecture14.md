## Unit 7
#### G-protein coupled receptors
* Ion channels ($K^+$ channels in heart muscle cells)
* Acetylcholine ligand
* $\beta \gamma$ Complex is activated, opens $K^+$ channels
* GTP attaches to $\beta \gamma$ and inactivates the $K^+$ channel

#### GPCRs activating adenylyl cyclase
* Begins with atp
* Adenylyl cyclase takes off two phosphates
* circularizes with the end of phosphates to the 3' carbon
* Cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase

#### Downstream events activating GPCRs
* Adrenaline activated GPCR (Adrenergic receptor)
* Adrenylyl cyclase with GTP
* cAMP activates protein kinase A
* Protein kinase phosphorylates other kinases
* Phosphorylase kinase (puts a phosphorus on phosphorylase)
* Active phosphorylase kinase activates a inactive glycogen phosphorylase
* Catalyzes the breakdown of glycogen into glucose


#### Basic idea:
* Ligand attaches to GPCR
* G-proteins


#### Activating phospholipase C
* Signal molecule binds to GPCR
* Activated GPCR allows GTP to activate $\beta \gamma$
* Activates Phospholipase C
* Works with phosphatidylinositol  
* Decapitates the polar head
* Inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate ($IP_3$)
* $IP_3$ is a second messenger
* Activates a $Ca^{2+}$ Ion channel (from ER to cytosol)
* Calcium activates Protein Kinase C (PKC) along with the cleaved diacylglycerol

Phospholipidase C $\rightarrow$ Calcium $\rightarrow$ Protein Kinase C

#### $Ca^{2+}$ as a intracellular signal
* Concentrations in the cytosol are very very low but can be very quickly increased
  * Opening of channels on plasma membrane
  * Opening of channels in ER
* Calmodulin
  * Calmodulin binds to some Calcium and wraps around a downstream protein
* Very powerful signal molecule

_This is the last slide for midterm2_

#### Enzyme-linked receptors
* Cell-surface receptors
* Two proteins dimerize when ligand/signal molecule binds
* Dimerized tails form active site
* "Phosphorylation fest"
* Active RTKs (kinases mediating GPCR responses)
* RTKs are tyrosine kinases
* Activated RTKs recruit other downstream proteins and get activated
* One common pathway

#### Activate the purplish protein
* Its an adapter protein
* Attracts inactive Ras protein
* Membrane associated, downstream of RTK signalling
* RKTs with downstream Ras involved in mediating cell growth differentiation and survival
* Most importantly regulates cell division
* Mutations in Ras can cause cancer
* Ras that is stuck on that drives cell division $\rightarrow$ unregulated cell division

__Cancer is a failure of cell communication__
* When a cell disobeys cell signals, bad things happen

## Unit 8
#### Eukaryotes
* Mitosis vs Meiosis
