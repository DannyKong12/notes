#### Electron Transport Chain
* NADH and FADH donate their electrons and get passed through three (or two) electrons and pump H+ out of the membrane through active transport
* creates a proton gradient across the molecules
* ATP synthase harnesses energy from the flow of H+ down the proton gradient to create ATP
* Chemiosmosis
* "Proton motive force"
* Protons can leak out to the cytosol, diffusing down the gradient
* Small amount of protons are going into the ATP synthase because of brownium motion

#### ATP synthase
* Composed of a rotor and a stator
* Rotor has a entry channel and an exit channel that forces H+ ions to bind to the rotor and push it before reaching the exit channel
* The rotor generates the energy to deform F1 ATPase and allow it to generate ATP

#### What happens when oxygen is not there
* NADH stops donating electrons with no final acceptor
* NAD is required once NADH donates its electron for the TCA cycle

#### Coping with an anaerobic lifestyle
* Lactic acid/alcoholic fermentation

#### Lactic acid fermentation
* Pyruvate is reduced and produces lactate
* Typically produced in muscle cells
*

#### Alcohol fermentation
* Pyruvate goes through a decarboxylase and produces acetaldehyde
* acetaldehyde accepts a final electron and produces ethanol

#### Facultative anaerobes
* can survive using either fermentation or respiration
* Many bacteria and yeast
* Can switch their metabolic activity
* Acetyl-CoA

#### Regulation of metabolic pathways
* Either produces ATP through respiration or produces fatty acids
* Phosphofructokinase can activate or inhibit depending on the concentration of ATP and ADP
* phosphofructokinase catalyzes the production of pyruvate
* Allosteric moderators using ADP and ATP
