#### Thermodynamics in Chemical Reactions
  * Gibbs free energy
  * $G_{reactants}-G_{products} = \Delta G$
  * An energetically favourable reaction must take place to release energy and induce
  an unfavourable reaction
  * Standard Gibbs Free Energy: $\Delta G^\circ$
  * Must do complicated reactions that are endergonic
  * Requires coupling of exergonic reactions with endergonic reactions
  * e.g. $ATP \rightarrow ADP + energy$ giving energy

#### Chemical Kinetics
  * Spontaneity has no direct effect on reaction rate
  * Cellular respiration is Kinetically unfavourable
  * Catalysis

#### Enzymes as catalysts
  * Identifiable by their suffix
  * "-ase"
  * physically interacts with reactants to speed up reaction rates
  * Reactants = Substrates
  * Remember that enzymes are necessary
  * Does not change the spontaneity of a reaction
  * They can only speed up a thermodynamically favourable reactions
  * also have no effect of equilibrium, e.g. speeds up reactions in the opposite direction as well

#### Activation Energy
  * Requires some amount of energy for a process to occur, even if it's spontaneous
  * Enzymes can reduce the activation energy, which speeds up the reaction

#### Example
  * single molecule of carbonic anhydrase in red blood cells can catalyze over 1 million reactions per second
  * $Urea \rightarrow H_2O + 2H^+$
  * uncatalyzed reaction takes one reaction every 105 years
  * Urease catalyzes the reaction to 1 per 0.033
  * Catalytic advantage (sped up rate factor) $10^{14}$
  * Enzymes cannot be consumed during catalysis

#### Enzyme Cofactors
  * Amino acids cannot always carry out all chemistry required
  * Non-protein factors help it do the required chemistry
  * Coenzymes are non-protein organic cofactors
  * Binds to the active site along with reactants
  * Coenzymes can be chemically changed e.g. $NAD^+$

#### Chemical regulation
  * Negative feedback
  * metabolic pathways can be shut off by cutting the production of enzymes
  * Regulatory molecules
  * binds to the enzyme and affects its ability to catalyze reactions
  * inhibitors/activators
  * Allosteric and Competitive $\rightarrow$ bonds to different site, bonds to active site
  * Allosteric can activate or inhibit
  * Competitive can only inhibit
  * Covalent modification
  * Phosphorylation

#### Importance of inhibitors
  * DDT inhibits enzymes in pests, as well as in humans
  * penicillin inhibits an enzyme in bacterial metabolic processes of the formation of peptidoglycan
  * HIV protease is essential for viral proteins
