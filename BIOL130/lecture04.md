#### Structural Polysaccharide
  * Cellulose
    * $\beta$-linkage
    * two different orientations of monomers
    * improves mechanical stability
    * Most cells cannot hydrolyze $\beta$-1,4 bonds
  * Cells can store glucose into large structures
    * these can be re-broken to return glucose
    * All cells can use starch and glycogen
  * __Can be non-linear__
  * A function of glucose storage
    * Cellulose, Chitin, peptidoglycan
    * Subcomponents of other molecules
  * glycocalyx

#### Lipids
  * fats, oils, triglycerides
    * Glycerol
      * three OH groups with three carbons
    * Fatty acids
      * ester linkages attached to each of the three OH
      * Saturated
      * Unsaturated
      * Double bonds
      * Saturated fats have long linear tails
      * Unsaturated fats have kinks and double bonds
      * cis vs trans unsaturated
  * sterols
    * Cholesterol
    * Testosterone
    * 3 hexose rings with a pentose
  * phospholipids
    * Like triglycerides with only two sterified sites
    * Polar head group with a phosphorus
    * Phosphatidylcholine
  * glycolipids
    * two fatty acids appended to a backbone and a sugar
  * lipid structures
  * amphipathic


## Thermodynamics
  * Energy
    * Kinetic Energy
    * Potential Energy
  * Exergonic/Endergonic
  * Exergonic reactions give energy for endergonic reactions
