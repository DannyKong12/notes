# Biol 130

#### Apical domain
  * Splits the cell into two 'hemispheres'
  * In 3D when cells are packed they form a surface of apical and basolateral domains

#### Eukaryotic cells are coated with sugars
  * Glyco calyx
  * Outside of eukaryotic cells have sugar coating

#### Membrane transport
  * Gasses, ions, nutrients/wastes can't easily pass through lipid bilayer
  * Most water-soluble molecules are blocked
  * Facilitated transport

#### How do molecules move
  * Diffuse
  * "Spreads" until reaches dynamic equilibrium
  * no net flux

#### Tonicity
  * Hypotonic — cell swells
  * Hypertonic — Cell shrinks

#### Membrane proteins
  * Channel proteins
  * Carrier proteins
  * Facilitate transport for large charged particles

#### Ion channels
  * Conductance of ions across membrane
  * Can only move down gradient
