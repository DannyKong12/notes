#### Membrane pumps
  * Examples: proton pumps, $Ca^{2+}$ pumps etc
  * Used for pushing particles across gradients in the opposite direction
  * Setting up concentration gradients for driving other reactions

#### Coupled transport
  * Sodium Potassium Pump
  * Uniports:
    * Same direction: symport
    * exchange: antiport
  * Using a Sodium cation to co-transport a molecule
    * Bind glucose to transport molecule
    * Load sodium into transport molecule until it changes shape and allow glucose in

#### Integral Membrane Proteins
  * Transport proteins
    * Passive transport (down gradient)
      * Ion Channel
      * Uniport (glut1)
    * Co-transport
      * Use transport coupled with passive
      * Secondary active
    * Pumps
      * active transport

#### Membrane proteins and gene expression
  * Each membrane has its own characteristic set of channels
  * Transporters are proteins
  * long QT syndrome, cystic fibrosis, malignant, hyperthermia

## Unit 7 Textbook 15.4 Protein Translocation

#### Protein sorting
  * __Synthesis of proteins starts in the cytosol on free ribosomes__
  * Signal Sequences
    * Without a signal sequence, proteins stay in the cytosol
    * If a protein contains a signal sequence it will get moved into a specific place

#### How to get into the Nucleus
  * Nucleus has large holes
  * Nuclear pores are highly selective while large
  * Pore complex proteins are fibrous proteins that form a basket
  * Proteins determine what can go through a nuclear pore
  * Nuclear proteins must go through protein basket
  * Escort protein (nuclear import receptor) moves large proteins through the pores

#### How to get into the ER
  * Secretory pathway starts in the ER
  * ER is the gatekeeper
  * Once a protein enters the ER, the protein doesn't return to the cytosol
  1. ER signal sequence begins transcription
  1. Nascent signal sequence attaches to Signal Recognition Particle
  1. SRP receptor pulls the nascent protein into the transcription channel
  * two types of proteins are transferred
    * Water soluble proteins translocated completely across
    * Transcribed halfway and is stuck in the membrane
