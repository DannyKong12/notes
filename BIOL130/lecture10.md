## Biological Membranes
#### Membrane Functions
  * lipid barrier
  * Selective permeability
  * Transport solutes
  * Signaling/signal transduction
  * ETC
  * Compartmentalization inside the cell

#### Phospholipids
  * phosphatidyl choline (serine ethanolamine inositol etc.)
  * Phospholipid Bilayer
  * phospholipids have lots of movement in the leaflet
  * Movement in the leaflets is required
  * Temperature affects the fluidity of a membrane

#### Phospholipid fluidity
  * Straight, saturated tails is less fluid
  * Desaturated create fluidity
  * trim lengths
  * add cholesterol to be less fluid
  * Fish tend to live in fluctuating temperature environments

#### Secretory pathway
  * Where does membrane come from?
  * Scramblases take random phospholipids and flip them to the non-cytosolic side
  * Flippases move phosphatidyl seriene and ethanolamine to cytosolic side
  * Cytosolic side enriched with phosphatidyl serine ethanolamine and inositol and on the other side is enriched with phosphatidyl choline and glycolipids
  * Phosphatidyl inositol is important for signal transduction
  * Membrane asymmetry is preserved in vesicle transport e.g. cytosolic still joins the cytosolic side

#### Red Blood Cells
  * RBCs are model organisms for plasma membrane

#### Membrane proteins
  * Proteins give the membrane its functions
  * Many types of proteins
    * Transporters
    * Anchors
    * Receptors
    * Enzymes
  * Ways of building proteins into membranes
    * Transmembrane*
    * Monolayer associated
    * lipid linked
    * Protein linked (peripheral)

#### Transmembrane proteins
  * Non-polar $\alpha$ helices
  * Channels can be formed with several helices
  * Circular $\beta$ pleated sheets

#### Membrane Protein Motion
  * Distribute themselves inside the membrane
  * Restriction of movement of membrane proteins
    * Tight junctions
    * 
    * basolateral
