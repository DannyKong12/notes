#### Vesicular Transport
  * General Vesicle traffic goes from ER to Golgi
  * What causes plasma membrane to bulge and form vesicles
  * Clathrin coated vesicles
  * Cargo receptor
  * Clathrin binds to the cargo receptors
  * Dynamin cuts off the vesicle
  * Uncoated and recycled

#### Vesicle Docking
  * Vesicle expresses a v-SNARE
  * Tethering protein pulls the vesicle close
  * t-SNARE pulls in the v-SNARE
  * Membranes fuse

#### ER Processing
  * Oxidizing environment, allows disulfide bonding
  * Glycosylation occurs in the ER
  * Prefab carbohydrate
  * Dollichol transfers a 14 sugar oligosaccharide to an asparagine
  * N-linked glycosylation
  * Can be displayed on the outside of the cell, part of the glycocalyx
  * Exposure of polar groups
  * Chaperone protein can sometimes fix misfolded proteins

#### Unfolded protein response
  * Misfolded proteins can start aggregating if production overwhelms folding
  * Cell builds ER to produce more protein
  * If cell can't fix misfolding, apoptosis

#### Steps along the secretory pathway
  * Entry face is called *cis* and exit is called *trans*
  * Proteins are modified again
    * Trim peptide chains
    * Create new amino acids by modification
    * Golgi adds O-linked glycosylation to Serine and Thr
  * Constitutive vs regulated secretion

#### Endocytosis
  * Pinocytosis and phagocytosis
  * Pinocytosis is done by all eukaryotic cells
  * Subtracts membrane when cells take in tiny vesicles constantly
  * Phagocytosis makes large vesicles
  * Receptor mediated endocytosis
  * Pinocytosis "samples" the environment by taking in small vesicles of environment

#### LDL
  * Low density lipoprotein
  * LDL is brought into the cell by clathrin coated receptor mediated endocytosis

#### Lysosomes
  *
