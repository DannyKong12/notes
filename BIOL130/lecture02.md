### Proteins
  * made up of chains of 20 genetically encoded amino acid monomers
  * A polypeptide we ascribe a certain function to is called a protein

#### Amino acid structure
  * amine + carboxylic acid = amino acid
  * center $\alpha$ carbon
  * in 19/20 atoms there are 4 bonds to the center carbon
  * Ionized in water, with a basic side and acidic side => neutral zwitterion
  * The $\alpha$ carbon in an AA is a chiral carbon (4 different things attached) => stereoisomerism
  * Proteins in cells only incorporate L amino acids
  * Glycine has two H bonded so its mirror stereoisomer is the same
  * the R group decides the amino acid
  * three main groups of amino acids\*
    * nonpolar
    * uncharged polar (partial charges)
    * charged polar
  * polarity determines hydrophobic/hydrophilic
  * like dissolves like
  * understand categorization

### Levels of Proteins

#### Level 1
  * primary structure/primary sequence
  * amino acids are linked by condensation
  * forms carbonyl (CO)
  * Linear sequence of polypeptides
  * Begins at the amino terminus and ends with carboxylic terminus
  * all the other amino/carboxyl groups are lost in condensation
  * 1 indexed numbering from the first amino group to the last

__Ex1:__ Importance of proteins
  * mutation in their Hb
  * substitution from glutamate at pos. 6 to valine
  * Substituted a very hydrophilic glutamate to a very hydrophobic valine

#### Higher order levels
  * Both sides of the $\alpha$ carbon (__NOT THE AMIDE CARBON/CARBONYL CARBON__)
  * 1500 shapes of protein folds
Secondary, tertiary, quaternary structure  
__Secondary:__
  * stabilized by hydrogen bonds along the backbone
  * Helices
    * held together by hydrogen bonds between carbonyl carbons and amino hydrogen
    * Compact twisted coils
    * Side chains are on the surface of the outside of the helix
    * primary chain determines the secondary structure
    * hydrophobic helices can be inserted in hydrophobic membranes
  * $\beta$-strands
    * $\beta$-sheets form parallel and anti-parallel sheets
    * Adjacent strands
    * more than one $\beta$-strand
    * anti-parallel are more prevalent


__Tertiary:__
  * Polypeptides are precisely twisted folded and coiled, into unique shapes
  * with $\alpha$ helical and $\beta$ sheet regions
  * determined by non-covalent forces
  * hydrophobic interactions
    * exclusion of water near hydrophobic areas
  * disulfide bonding
    * makes a covalent bond between two sulfurs
    * only occurs between cysteine
    * due to disulfhydryl bonds
    * strongest bonds between functional groups
    * typically used outside the cell in more hostile environments
    * provides additional stabilization
  * Stability
    * all intra-protein forces folds proteins from a chain
    * by changing conditions that affect the non-covalent bond structures => change strength
    * salt concentration, pH, temperature, etc.
    * primary structure is retained
    * disulfide bonds are retained as well
  * Renaturing
    * add chemical denaturants => induce denaturization
    * by removing the chemical denaturants => renatured proteins
    * shows that all necessary "information" is encoded in the primary sequence
  * mis-folding proteins
    * any mutation in the primary structure
    * primary sequence dictates the shape of the protein, which dictates functionality
  * Potential outcomes
    * Loss of function
    * Folds, then denatures after some time
    * Misfolds, and does not get degraded or plaques
      * associated with neurological diseases
      * ALS, Alzheimers, Parkinsons, etc.
      * without dealing with aggregates of plaques, cells can die

__Quaternary:__
  * used with suffix -mer
  * two subunits -> dimer
  * hemoglobin -> tetramer
  * homodimer -> same subunits
