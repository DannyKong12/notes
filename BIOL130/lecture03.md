### Nucleic Acids

#### Nucleic acids as information polymers
  * Polymeric
  * Nery narrow categories of function
  * deoxyribonucleic acids (DNA)
  * ribonucleic acids (RNA)
  * Differences and similarities
    * phosphate + deoxyribose + base (DNA)
    * phosphate + ribose + base (RNA)
    * A G C T (DNA)
    * A G C U (RNA)
  * Each nucleotide:
    * nitrogenous base
    * a 5-carbon pentose sugar
    * phosphate
  * Pyrimidine nucleotides
    * Uracil
    * Cytosine
    * Thymine
  * Purine nucleotides
    * Adenine
    * Guanine
  * Pentose
    * two kinds of pentose
    * $\beta$-ribose
  * note: ribose + base = nucleoside
          ribose + base + phosphate = nucleotide
    e.g. nucleoside triphosphate

#### Functions of Monomeric nucleotides
  * Monomeric units of RNA and DNA have functions of their own
  * e.g. cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) for signaling
  * Important agents in energy transfer  
        $ATP \longrightarrow ADP + P_i + ENERGY$
  * coenzymes
    * required for enzyme function
    * get altered during chemical processes
      * Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NAD)
      * Flavin Adenine Dinucleotide (FAD)

#### Creation of nucleotides
  * condensation reactions (again)
  * $3^\prime$ and $5^\prime$ link
  * phosphodiester linkage
  * Asymmetric, linear bonds
  * $5^\prime$ end, beginning
  * $3^\prime$ end, end
  * New neucleotides are only added at the $3^\prime$ end
  * Nucleotide condensation is not thermodynamically favourable
  * relies on ATP

#### Monomers of Nucleic Acids
  * DNA double stranded anti-parallel
  * Backbone made up of sugars and phosphates
  * Only pyrimidine-purine bonds can fit inside the helix
    * pyrimidines are tiny, bond length long
    * purines are fat they take up too much space
    * Adenine-Thymine
    * Guanine-Cytosine

#### Higher Order DNA Structure
  * compaction
  * additional structure to reduce the overall volume
  * formation of $X$ shaped chromosomes

#### RNA vs. DNA
  * extra 2' hydroxyl group
  * Uracil instead of thymine, missing methyl group
  * DNA is very stable structure, whereas RNA degrades easily as an intermediate molecule
  * Still has complementary base pairing, but only with itself

#### Other RNAs
  * mRNA -> code for protein
  * rRNA -> form ribosomes
  * miRNAs -> regulate gene stuff

### Carbohydrates
  * 1:2:1 ratio between carbon hydrogen oxygen
  * oligosaccharides -- small chains
  * polysaccharides -- long chains
  * can be bonded to macromolecules to form glycoproteins or glycolipids etc.
  * __glycocidic bonds__ form polysaccharides

#### Diversity in carbohydrates
  * Diversity in monomers
    * 3, 5, 6 carbon sugars, etc.
    * mostly focus on hexose sugars
  * isomeric forms
    * glucose
    * fructose
    * galactose
    * can be structural or stereoisomers
    * aldose vs ketose
  * Occurs because of chiral carbons
  * 16 different aldo-hexose structures
  * 8 ket0-hexose structures
  * $\alpha$ vs $\beta$ carbon
  * $C_1$ is the anomeric carbon that decides the anomer
  * monomers are linked by the $C_1$ carbon
  * linkages are named $\alpha$-1,4 link or $\beta$-1,4 link

#### Branch
  * links can be non-linear
  * 1, 4 bonds are create linear chains
  * 1, 6 bonds can create branched polymers
