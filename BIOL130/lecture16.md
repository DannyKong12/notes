#### Cell count control
* Apoptosis
  * Programmed cell death
  * Occurs sometimes during development
  * Caspases help the cell die
  * Usually stored in procaspase (inactive) form
  * BCL-2 regulation
  * pro-apoptotic proteins: Bax Bak Bad
  * anti-apoptotic proteins: BCL-2

#### Causes of Apoptosis
* cell stress
* DNA damage
* free radicals
* lack of 'survival factors'

#### Caspase cascade
* Amplifying caspase cascade
* Single molecule of active Caspase X
* Activates more of Caspase Y

#### Cytochrome C
* Release of Cytochrome C in the mitochondria

#### Cancer is imbalance between cell growth and cell death

#### Increasing cell number
* Transcription factors for BCL-2
* Mitogen receptors activate G1/S-Cdk activates transcription regulator
* myostatin
*
