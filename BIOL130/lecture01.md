## Unit 2b - Macromolecules
#### 4 main groups:
  * fatty acids/lipids\*
  * carbohydrates
  * proteins
  * nucleic acids
  * \*not clearly polymeric

#### A general theme for generating macromolecules
  * Condensation reaction
  * Water is being removed when {HO} and {HO} link
  * Reversible by hydrolysis
  * Valid for most types of polymerization

#### Proteins
  * Have more functions than any other group of macromolecules
    * Enzymes     - catalysts, improves vital reaction rates
    * Transport   - through cell membranes, in circulation
    * Support     - cytoskeletal fibres, cartilage, hair, nails
    * Signaling   - hormones, membrane proteins, intracellular messengers
    * Movement    - contractile proteins, flagella
    * defense     - antibodies

#### Proteins as polymers
  * amino acid chains
  * di- tri- tetra-
  * on its own, an animo group is a single amino acid
  *
