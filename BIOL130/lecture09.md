## Second part of central dogma

#### Gene expression
  * genotype -> proteins/functions -> phenotype
  * 3 letter codons of 4 letters = 64 "words"
  * One codon means at most one amino acid, but an amino acid could have more than 1 codon
  * Code is almost universal

#### Mutations in the code

$$\begin{align}
&& Parent\ DNA && AATAATAATAAT... \\
&& 1 \ base \ deletion && ATAATAATAATA... \\
&& 2\ base\ deletions && TAATAATAATAA... \\
&& 3\ base\ deletions && AATAATAATAAT...
\end{align}$$

#### how does mRNA recognize codons

#### what do tRNAs look like?
  * clover leaf structure
  * attached amino acid at the 3' end

#### Amino acid peptide bond to the tRNA requires energy
  * aminoacyl tRNA synthetase binds an ATP to an amino acid before synthesizing
  * builds aminoacyl-ATP

#### How many tRNA's are there
  * there are 40 tRNAs and 64 codons that can be formed
  * serine tRNA can pair with UCA which is the match pair, but also with UCU and UCG
  * this is called the "wobble theory"
  * You can have mismatch at the third position of the codon/anti-codon

#### Components of (eukaryotic) Ribosomes
  * large subunit: ~49 proteins + 3 RNA molecules
  * small subunit: ~33 proteins + one RNA
  * Complete ribosome 40M MW
  * Prokaryotic Ribosomes are massive
    * Large subunit on top of small subunit
    * between the subunits is a mRNA
    * a site at the bottom of the large subunit has the E, P, A sites
    * in a groove at the top has the

#### Translational process
  * Starting the process of translation
    * Small Ribosomal Subunit binds to the 5' Cap with initiator tRNA
    * Slides down looking for the first AUG with a MET tRNA
    * Large ribosomal subunit binds
    * charged tRNA binds to A site
    * first peptide bond forms between the start AA (Methionine) and the first AA
  * \< repetitive process starts here >
  * Termination
    * the complex reaches the stop codon
    * there are no tRNA that matches the stop codon
    * a release factor protein binds to the stop codon
    * allows the water molecule to bind at the end of the Amino acid and stops binding

#### Efficienty of Translation
  * multiple ribosomes are translating the same mRNA at the same time, starting at the same point one after another

#### Antibiotics
  * tetracycline targets binding of aminoacyl-tRNAs to the A-site of ribosome
  * chloramphenicol blocks peptidyl transferase reaction on ribosomes
  * cycloheximide blocks translocation reaction on ribosomes

#### Protein folding during translation
  * proteins fold spontaneously
  * Folds while the protein is synthesizing
  * although proteins fold spontaneously, an incomplete protein may get stuck folding into a different shape than a complete protein
  * chaperone's help the proteins fold properly so they aren't stuck
  * most front segments will fold properly

#### Post-translational modifications
  * Amino acids can be modified after they are translated
  * e.g.
    glycosylation
    lipoylation
    phosphorylation
    ubiquitination â€” addition of a ubiquitin
    methylation
    acetylation
    proteolysis
  * roughly 30 different PTMs

#### Protein diversity
  * 20,000-25,000 genes -> 100,000 transcripts by alternative splicing
  * 100,000 transcripts -> 1,000,000 proteins in the proteome by post-translational splicing
  *
