#### Kinase-Phosphorylase vs GTP
* Kinase-Phosphorylase
  * Protein kinase takes a phosphare from ATP to produce ADP and phosphate
  * Adds it to a target protein
  * Target protein is activated and does things (downstream proteins)
  * Activates...
    * metabolic
    * activate other kinases
  * Protein Kinase A (PKA) turned on by cAMP
    * Phosphorylate serine/threonine
  * Protein Kinase C (PKC) turned on by Ca2+ + DAG
  * Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (RTK) ligands binding -> dimerization
    * Phosphorylate tyrosine residues on each other
  * Phosphatase turns off phosphorylated proteins
  *
* GPCRs
  * $\alpha$ subunit binds to GDP/GTP
  * Two shapes:
    1. GDP bound -> inactive -> $\alpha\beta\gamma$ all together
    1. GTP bound -> active -> $\alpha$ goes to target $\beta\gamma$ goes to downstream

## Unit 9 Mitosis-Meiosis

#### Phases:
* M phase
* G phase

#### Transient cytoskeletal structures
* Major tubulin production
* Actin (and myosin) build contractile ring

#### Cleavage furrow
* Actin pinches plasma membrane with a ring that contracts

#### Plant cytokinesis
* Vesicles filled with cell wall components collect near new wall
* Wall is built using materials from vesicles

#### Meiosis
*
