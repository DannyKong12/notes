### Sensory Systems
![table 10.1](../static/BIOL373/table10.1.png)
* Sensory Pathways:
  * Stimulus $\rightarrow$ receptor transduction $\rightarrow$ action potentials travel along neuron $\rightarrow$ subcortical integrating centers $\rightarrow$ information reaches appropriate regions in cortex
* Spinal reflexes initiate without input from the brain, but require integration with brain to be "felt"
* Sensory receptors vary in complexity
  * Simple, free nerve endings
    * Nothing on ends, neurons have nothing along its branches
  * Receptors with nerve endings enclosed
    * Nerve endings enclosed in layers of connective tissues
    * Often have nodes of ranvier
  * Specialized neurones
* Receptors can be grouped according to type of stimulus:
  * Chemoreceptors (responds to oxygen, pH, various organic molecules)
  * Mechanoreceptors (responds to pressure changes, cell stretch, vibration, acceleration, sound)
  * Photoreceptors (photons)
  * Thermoreceptors (varying degrees of heat)

#### Signal Transduction
* Starts with graded potentials
* Each sensory receptor has an "adequate stimulus" (e.g. certain receptors have a type of energy to which it responds to best)
* Stimulus opens or closes ion channels in receptor cell membranes
  * either directly or via second messenger systems
  * Mostly typically cations

#### Sensory Neurons have Receptive Fields
* Somatosensory neurons and visual neurons are activated by stimuli that fall within a certain physical area
  * Cutaneous receptors cover a small patch of skin
  * Photoreceptors capture light falling on an entire area
* At least two afferent neurons in pathway to brain
  * First order (primary) sensory neuron is directly associated with the stimuli
  * Second order (secondary) or higher relays information from primary neuron
  * Example:
    (fig receptive fields)
    * Receptors of the same sense may have receptive fields that overlap
    * Multiple primary neurons may converge to the same neuron
    * Also allows summation of multiple stimuli, and also creates a larger receptive field
    * Possibly increases sensitivity, decreases resolution
* Second order sensory neuron sets receptive field, higher secondary:primary ratio gives higher resolution

#### Sensory information is integrated in the CNS
![fig 10.3](../static/BIOL373/fig10.3/png)
* Different destinations for different senses
* Special senses tends to have their own region
* Most senses go through the thalamus (thalamic relay) except two:
  * Olfactory pathway goes to the olfactory cortex
  * Balance/equilibrium goes to the cerebellum

#### Visceral Sensory Information
* Most visceral senses don't reach consciousness, unless they spill over into somatosensory
* Mostly integrated within the brain stem and spinal chord

#### Coding of Sensation
* Primary goal of signal transduction is to convert graded potential into AP
* All APs are identical and equal in intensity
* CNS must be able to decode:
  * Type
  * Intensity
  * Tonality
* Labelled line coding
  * Receptors are "labelled", CNS will know what an AP from a particular sensory neuron represents
  * Made possible by adequate stimulus
  * Location is coded into where receptive fields are activated
    * an AP from any part of the pathway will give the same sensation
  * Lateral inhibition allows for greater inhibition
    * Large stimulus of one neuron (e.g. touch) may inhibit neurons nearby, next order neurons, nearby neurons will exhibit a lower graded potential
    * A way of processing "information" before it reaches CNS
* Stimulus intensity
  * Can be coded by number of receptors activated (population coding)
    * Different receptors may have different levels of threshold
    * Low intensity will hit threshold first, and when stimulus increases, higher intensity will also hit threshold, increasing population size
  * Tonal frequency and duration
    * APs fire many times during a single stimulus
    * High intensity signals will fire at a higher frequency
  * Receptors can be tonic or phasic
    * Tonic has steady, consistent action potentials during whole stimulus
    * Phasic fires quickly when the level of a stimulus changes

### Somatic Senses
#### Modalities of Somatic Senses
* touch
* temperature
* nociception
* proprioception

#### Somatorysensory Pathways
![fig 10.8](../static/BIOL373/fig10.8.png)
* Decasation
* Somatosensory neural pathways cross the body midline
  * Senses originating from the left ascend into right side of brain and vice versa
  * Fine touch (proprioception, vibration)
    * Enters the dorsal root and ascends into dorsal column tract into brain stem
    * Second order crosses midline in the medulla and enters the thalamus
  * Coarse touch (nociception, temperature)
    * Crosses midline in spinal cord, ascents via spino-thalamic tracts

#### Finer information crosses high, crude information crosses low

#### Somatic Senses - Modalities
* Touch
* Temperature
* Nociception
* Proprioception
  * Sensory information from skin and muscle/joint

#### Cutaneous Sensory Receptors
* Structure/Location
  * Free Nerve Endings
    * Wraps around hair root
    * Lies in upper epidermis alone
  * Meissner's corpuscle, Merkel's disk
    * Lies in upper epidermis
    * Very small receptive fields
    * High resolution touch
  * Pacinian Corpuscles, Ruffini's Corpuscles
    * Lies deeper in epidermis
    * Much larger receptive fields
    * Low resolution touch
|receptor|location|receptive field|adaptation|function|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Merkel's disk|superficial|small|slow|sustained touch/pressure, texture|
|Meissner's corpuscle|superficial|small|fast|beginning and end of fine touch/pressure|
|Ruffini's corpuscle|deep|large|slow|sustained gross touch/vibration/stretch|
|Pacinian corpuscle|deep|large|fast|Beginning and end of gross touch/vibration|
|Free Nerve Endings|variable|variable|variable|

#### Nociception
* *noci* derived from Latin *nocere* to injure or do harm
* nociceptors found in many tissues
* pain is a sensation rather than stimulus
* Mediated by free nerve endings expressing ion channels that respond to a variety of strong stimuli
* Pain is mediated via release of local chemicals
  * $K^+$, histamines, prostaglandins, serotonin, substance P
  * Can either directly or indirectly affect nociceptors
* Destroys the idea of adequate stimuli

#### Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) Channels
* 28 different channels across animal kingdom
* expressed on membranes of many different cell types
* TRPV receptors respond to things like pepper, allicin, thyme oregano, wasabi, menthol, peppermint etc.
  * TRPV1 responds to heat, capsaicin, mustard, wasabi, $H^+$

#### Somatic Pain
* Information from nociceptors can follow several pathways
  * Spinal reflexes
  * Ascending pathways to cerebral cortex
  * Information sent to limbic system, hypothalamus
    * Emotional reactions
    * Autonomic responses

#### Pain transmits slowly across thin fibres
* Thinly/not myelinated
* Thin fibres
* Not nearly as fast as other reflexes

#### Visceral Pain, Referred Pain
* Pain is not felt at the organ
* Pain is poorly localized in organs
* Visceral afferent sensory neurons reaches second order neurons connected to skin sensory secondary neurons in other areas

### Neural Reflexes

#### Classification of Neural Reflexes
* According to effector
  * Skeletal muscle
    * Controlled by somatic motor neurons
  * Smooth and cardiac muscle, glands, adipose tissue
    * Controlled by autonomic neurons
* According to integrating centre
  * Spinal reflexes, 'cranial' reflex
* Innate vs learned
* Number of neurons in pathway
  * Mostly polysynaptic

#### Autonomic (Visceral) Reflexes
* Some are spinal reflexes
  * Modulated by signals
* Others are integrated in brain (hypothalamus, thalamus, brain stem)
* Emotional Stimuli

#### Skeletal Muscle Reflexes
![fig 13.1](../static/BIOL373/fig13.1.png)
* Example of monosynaptic
* Most often include interneurons
* Monitors proprioception, effort exerted in lifting, holding objects
  * Requires sensory information
* Efferent pathway:
  * Somatic motor neurons ('alpha' motor neurons)
* Effectors:
  * Extrafusile muscle fibres

#### Proprioceptors

#### Muscle Spindles
![fig 13.2](../static/BIOL373/fig13.2.png)
* Muscle Spindles (fusiform)
* Ends of spindle are contractile
* Center lacks myofibrils
* Inside, muscles are called intrafusal fibres
* Lengthening the spindle sends signals
* Center part of spindle has afferent fibres
* Neurons are tonically active
* Tendons contain Golgi tendon organs
* Ends of neuron interlaced in collagen connective fibres
* Main stimulus is muscle stretch/increased muscle length

#### Stretch Reflexes
* Muscles have an ideal resting length
* In the absence of descending information, body maintains resting length
* Spindle mediated reflex send signal to extrafusile muscle
* Also inhibits antagonistic muscle groups (reciprocal inhibition)

#### Patellar Reflex
* Tap to the kneecap lengthens the tendon over the knee
* Response is to contract quadriceps to counter sensed muscle contraction

#### Muscle Spindles can be Unloaded
* When muscle shortens, unless tightened up by spindle
* Alpha motor neurons contract muscle
* Gamma motor neuron adjusts the sensitivity of spindle
* When muscles are contracted, spindle shortens and becomes loose and stops sending signal
* Gamma motor neuron signals are linked to alpha motor neuron ennervation
* Ends of spindle contract and keeps on sending signals
* "alpha-gamma coactivation"

#### Change in Muscle Tension is sensed by Golgi Tendon Organ
* Isometric contraction is a string stimulus for GTO
* GTO stretches on contraction force
* Extreme stretch is inhibitory to contraction
* Not sensitive to muscle stretch

#### Withdrawal and Crossed Extensor Reflexes
* Pain stimulus activates nociceptor
* Primary sensory neuron enters spinal cord and diverges
* CC to brain to inform on sensation (pain) and postural adjustment
* Flexion and relaxation
![13.7](../static/BIOL373/fig13.7.png)

#### Integrated Control of Movement
* Body must continuously adjust its position to compensate for differences between intended movement and actual one
* Muscles can't communicate with each other
  * Coordination mediated by CNS
* Muscle Reflex
  * Primarily driven by external stimuli
  * Inherent, rapid
![fig 13.8](../static/BIOL373/fig13.8.png)

#### Voluntary Movement
* Phases of Voluntary Movement
![fig 13.9](../static/BIOL373/fig13.9.png)
  * Cerebellum and Basal Ganglia
  * Motor Cortex initiates movement
  * Cerebellum is informed after movement
* Damage to the cerebellum negatively affects movement

#### Basal Ganglia
* Results from death of dopamine secreting neurons in a particular region of the basal ganglia
* Motor symptoms include tremors at rest, slowness of movement, rigidity
