#### Central Nervous System
![fig 9.1](../static/BIOL373/fig9.1.png)
* Evolutionary trends in Nervous Systems
  * Invertebrates and simple organisms have fairly diffuse networks of nervous tissue
  * Bilateral symmetry $\rightarrow$ cephalization
  * Consolidation of peripheral nervous system into nerves
  * Consolidation into forebrain
* All vertebrates will develop a neural tube
  * Neural Tube is the precursor of the CNS
  * Neural crest cells will migrate throughout the body and produces nervous system

#### Development of the Human CNS
![fig 9.2](../static/BIOL373/fig9.2.png)
* Anterior end of Neural tube specializes into 3 regions of the brain
* Focus on the forebrain

#### Adult Brain and Spinal Chord
![fig 9.3](../static/BIOL373/fig9.3.png)
* Protection and support for the CNS
  * Surrounded by bony cage (cranium, vertebrae)
  * Three layers of connective tissue - meninges (pia mater, arachnoid, dura mater)
    (picture from slides)
    * Dura mater attaches to bone
    * Arachnoid attaches to Dura mater and weblike network that attaches to pia mater
  * Fluid between layers, cerebrospinal fluid

#### Subdural Hematoma
* Blood vessels between arachnoid and pia mater
* Torn cerebral veins bleed into space between arachnoid and pia mater

#### The CNS contains fluid filled cavities
* 4 Cavities called ventricles - lateral, third, fourth
* All cavities are interconnected with each other and the spinal canal
* CSF fills the cavities and is continuously produced and drained from the brain
* Choroid plexus produces CSF and secretes it into cavities
* Compared to plasma, CSF has very low protein and no blood cells
* CSF also has comparatively lower $K^+$, $Ca^{2+}$, $HCO_3$, glucose, pH
* Choroid plexus are a type of ependymal cell, and decide what ends up in the CSF
* 4x of fluid volume is produced a day by the choroid plexus
![fig 9.4](../static/BIOL373/fig9.4.png)
* CSF pushes towards 4th ventricle into subarachnoid space
* Arachnoid tissue pushes through dural mater into a space called dural/sagittal sinus
* dural sinus is a space leading to venous return to the heart

#### Circulation of CSF
* Choroid Plexus continuously producing CSF into ventricles
* Ventricles drain into subarachnoid space
* subarachnoid drains into dural sinus

#### Hydrocephalus
* Blockage of circulation in CSF
* Typically in the already narrow passageways between ventricles

#### Blood Brain Barrier
* Astrocytes seal off capillaries with foot processes
* Lipid soluble molecules cross barrier easily
* Hydrophilic substances that are required by brain will cross if specific transporters are present on the endothelial cells
  * Antihistamines are made to not cross the blood brain barrier
  * Brain diseases are treated with drugs that are specifically made to cross
  * Parkinsons is a deficiency of dopamine in the brain
    * Dopamine is not transportable across the blood brain barrier
    * L-DOPA is transportable by L-Tyrosine transporters, which can produce dopamine

#### Metabolic Quirks of Neural Tissue
* Neurons are obligate aerobes (cannot undergo anaerobic metabolism)
* Large glucose requirement
  * Transporters
  * Brain as a whole consumes ~50% of glucose
* Vasculature
  * Brain cannot undergo anaerobic metabolism
  * Dedicated blood supply
  * Critically dependent on oxygen, glucose, therefore bloodflow

### Spinal Chord
* The Spinal Chord is a major information pathway between the CNS and the PNS

#### Spinal Chord Segments
![fig 9.6](../static//fig9.6.png)
* White matter made of myelinated axons
* Grey matter is made up of cell bodies, axons, dendrites, etc
  * Grey matter allows integration
  * Consists of sensory and motor nuclei
* Efferent leave through ventral
* Afferent enter through dorsal

#### White Matter in the Spinal Chord
* White matter organized into Ascending and Descending tracts
* Ascending
  * Includes dorsal columns, spinocerebellar, spinothalamic
  * In general, "fine" senses ascend into DC
  * "coarse" senses ascend through spinothalamic
* Descending
  * Includes lateral and anterior (ventromedial) corticospinal tracts

#### Spinal Reflexes
![fig 9.7](../static/BIOL373/fig9.7.png)
* There exist reflexes that do not have the brain as the "integrating center"
* Reflex may still involve brain through senses (eg proprioception)
* Reflex mediated entirely through CNS in the spine

#### CNS Development
![fig 9.2](../static/BIOL373/fig9.2.png)
* Forebrain forms cerebrum, medulla, cerebellum
* By birth, cerebrum covers most of the brain

#### Brain Stem
![fig 9.8](../static/BIOL373/fig9.8.png)
* Oldest part of the brain evolutionarily
* Derived from embryonic hindbrain and some midbrain
  * Structures like pons, thalamus, medulla
  * Carry information from the spine, organized like the spine
  * Many cranial nerves originate from brain stem
* Diffuse network of coordinate sleeping, arousal, BP, breathing

#### Brain Stem Structures and Function
* Midbrain
  * coordination of visual and auditory reflexes
  * eye movement
* Pons
  * Regulates breathing
  * relay station between cerebrum and cerebellum
* Medulla
  * Grey matter involved in involuntary functions
  * White matter including ascending and descending tracts
  * Crossing over site (high crossing)

#### Brain Anatomy
* Cerebrum composed of lobes
  * Frontal, Parietal, Temporal, Occipital
* Diencephalon is tucked inside the cerebrum
  * Composed of Thalamus, Hypothalumus, glands
  * Information relay to cerebral cortex

#### Cerebrum
* Site of higher brain function
* Furrowed/grooved (sulcus)
* Convolution (gyrus)
* Organization
![fig 9.10](../static/BIOL373/fig9.10.png)
  * Three regions with grey matter
    * Basal ganglia (nuclei )
      * Coordinates movement
    * Limbic System
      * emotions/fear
      * Links with higher brain function
    * Cerebral Cortex
  * Lots of grey matter in the brain
    * (cell bodies, dendrites, axons allow for integration)
  * Thick band of fibres connect left and right side (corpus callosum)
  * Basal ganglia is pink, dense grey matter

#### Brain Function
![fig 9.12](../static/BIOL373/fig9.12.png)
* Brain takes the simple reflex further
  * example of simple reflex is a spinal reflex
  * Behavioral state influences brain output
    * asleep, anxiety, mental state
    * influences the outcome of a reflex
    * Reflexes can influence behavioral state as well
  * Cognition can influence brain output
    * We can voluntarily make decisions that impact reflexes
    * e.g. overriding a withdrawal reflex

#### Functional Cerebral Cortex
* Organised into three main sections
  * Sensory input to perception
  * Motor areas
  * Association areas (big)
![fig 9.13](../static/BIOL373/fig9.13.png)
* Frontal Lobe
  * Primary motor cortex
    * The movement area
    * Descending efferent motor neurons start here
  * Motor association area
  * Prefrontal association area
* Parietal Lobe
  * Primary somatic sensory cortex
  * Sensory association area

#### Primary Motor and Somatosensory Cortices
* Motor cortex
  * just before the central sulcus
  * (precentral gyrus)
  * Contains cell bodies of the upper motor neurons
* Somatosensory Cortex
  * On the ridge just after the central sulcus
  * (postcentral gyrus)
  * Terminals of ascending pathway
  * Fine/coarse touch, pain/itch, temperature, proprioception

#### Somatotopic maps
* Surface of the motor and somatosensory cortices can be mapped according to nerve endings on the other end
  * "maps" of body parts to the surface of the brain

#### Wilder Penfield
* Creator of the cortical homunculus
* Opened peoples brains and prodded them to "map" the sensations at certain points in the brain

#### Voluntary Movement - Pathway
![fig 13.11](../static/BIOL373/fig13.11.png)
* Recall that a motor neuron begins in the primary motor cortex
  * Travels down through the thalamus, through the midbrain to the medulla
  * "high crossing" neurons cross at the caudal medulla
  * "low crossing" neurons cross at the spinal segment
  * "high crossing" neurons cross and then enter lateral corticospinal tract
  * "low crossing" directly enter the anterior (ventromedial) corticospinal tract
  * Exits at the ventral horn

#### Voluntary Movement - Coordination
![fig 13.10](../static/BIOL373/fig13.10.png)
* Most of coordination occurs before the spinal chord
* Sensory Cortex, Prefrontal Cortex and association areas, Basal Ganglia, Cerebellum, all involved

#### Inhibiting Reflexes
* Withdrawal reflex on soles of feet are spinal reflexes
* Integration in the spinal chord, also sends signal to brain (nociception)
