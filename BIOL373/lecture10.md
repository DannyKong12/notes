### Control of GI Function
![fig 21.11](../static/BIOL373/fig21.11.png)
* Nerve plexuses between muscle layers of the GI tract
* Enteric Nervous System (gut brain)
* Distension/presence of food/osmolarity/acid influences sensory cells and neurons
* Integration occurs within the GI tract

#### Parallels between Enteric and Central Nervous System
* Has intrinsic neurons that lie entirely within gut (like interneurons of CNS)
  * Autonomic neurons that bring signals from CNS to gut are considered extrinsic
* Releases 30+ different NTs and neuromodulators
  * But not NE/E/AcH
* Has glial support cells (similar to astrocytes)
* Diffusion barrier - capillaries surrounding ganglia are not very permeable
* act as integrating center - *can autoregulate without CNS*

#### Reflexes Involving Gut Peptides
* Look at short vs. long reflexes in slide

#### Beginnings of Endocrinology
* Pancreas produces bicarb (not all the time) and secretes into duodenum
  * How does pancreas know exactly when to secrete bicarb into duodenum?
  * Pavlov: Idea is that pancreatic secretion is controlled by the vagus nerve
  * Bayliss and Starling: dissected away all nerves surrounding pancreas duodenum, acid in the duodenum still induces still secreted
  * New hypothesis becomes: acid release of signal from duodenum into blood
  * Treated lining of duodenum with acid, injected back into blood intravenously, induced bicarb secretion
  * Found that bicarb secretion is possible without nervous input

#### Family of Gut Hormones
* Gastrin family
  * Major targets are stomach
* Secretin Family
  * secretin, vasoactive intestinal peptide, gastric inhibitory peptide, glucagon like peptide 1
* Motilin Family
  * motilin acts on gut smooth muscle
  * regulates migrating motor complexes

#### Overview of GI Function - Control points  
![fig 21.12](../static/BIOL373/fig21.12.png)
* Oral cavity
* Upper esophageal sphincter
* Lower esophageal sphincter
* Pylorus
* Ileocecal valve
* Rectum
* Anal

#### Digestion begins in the mouth
* Saliva - secretion under autonomic control
  * Softens and lubricates food
  * salivary amylase and some lipases begin to act on starches and fats
  * Chewing (mastication) begins mechanical action of digestion
  * transfers to stomach (deglutition)

#### Swallowing Reflex
![fig 21.14](../static/BIOL373/fig21.14.png)
* Trachea and esophagus are very close together
* Epiglottis is the only thing blocking the trachea/esophagus
* Integration of reflex happens in the medulla
* sensory afferents in the cranial nerve IX and somatic motor and autonomic neurons mediate the reflex

#### Transition into the Stomach
* Lining of the stomach is uniquely able to handle extremely low pH
* Don't want acid to splash back up into esophagus: default closed

#### Cephalic and Gastric phase
* Gastric phase is presence of food in the stomach, Cephalic is anticipation
* Sensory information (sight/smell/etc) input into brain and integration
  * Medulla oblongata down vagus nerve into enteric plexus, which is an integrating center
  * Secretion of target cells
  * (relatively) Long-term *feedforward* reflex
* Gastric senses (distension/acid)
  * short loop reflex
  * Sensory to the enteric plexus
  * Enteric plexus decides action

#### Gastric Phase
* Stomach has three main functions
  * storage:
    * Neurally mediated, receptive relaxation of upper stomach
    * Gastric Dumping Syndrome
  * Digestion:
  * Protection:
    * Low pH and stomach enzymes protect against foreign organisms

#### Secretory cells of Gastric Mucosa
![fig 21.15](../static/BIOL373/fig21.15.png)
* Enterochromaffin like cell (ECL)
  * Recall: Chromaffin cell was a cell in the adrenal medulla, produces epinephrine/norepinephrine (neurosecretory cells/neuroendocrine)
  * ECL Secretes histamine
* Parietal Cells
  * Produces gastric acid and the intrinsic factor
  * Stimulated by ACh, gastrin, histamine
* G Cells
  * releases Gastrin

#### Functions of Gastric Secretory Products
* Parietal Cells -> Acid
  * Activates pepsin
  * denatures proteins, makes them more accessible
  * Anti-microbial
* Chief cells -> pepsinogen -> pepsin
  * Endopeptidase
    * particularly effective on collagen
  * Also produces gastric lipases
* ECL cells -> histamine
  * binds to H2 receptors on parietal cells -> promotes acid secretion
* Gastrin
  * Triggered by both long and short loop reflexes
* Somatostatin from D cells
  * shuts down secretion of acid and pepsinogen
  * negative feedback regulator

#### Integration of Cephalic and Gastric Phases
![fig 21.16](../static/BIOL373/fig21.16.png)
* Cephalic (food anticipation) can start stomach (Gastric) function
  * Input via vagus nerve
  * Stimulates G cells, ECL cells, Parietal cells
  * Negative pathway:
    * D cells produce Somatostatin
    * Influences G/Parietal/ECL to stop
* Gastric Phases
  * Regardless of Vagus Nerve Stimulation
  * Food/AAs/Peptides stimulates enteric sensory neuron
  * G cell produces gastrin, which stimulates acid secretion and histamine secretion
  * Less "push"

#### Prevention/Treatment of Peptic Ulcers
* Peptic ulcers occur when the mucosal surface is damaged
  * The muscus layer destroyed by acid and pepsin
  * Damage can extend into submucosa and muscularis layers
* Main treatment was antacids
* Modern approaches include
  * H2 receptor
  * H/K ATPase

#### Stimulation of Parietal Cell Acid Secretion
* Resting parietal Cell has fewer H/K-ATPase channels than active
* Similar to vasopressin story with aquaporins, signals (Gastrin/Histamine/ACh) dump vesicle bound channels into the epithelium

#### Integration of Gastric and Intestinal Phase
* Intestinal phase begins with controlled entry of chyme into small intestine
![fig 21.17](../static/BIOL373/fig21.17a.png)
* Intestinal phases slow down the stomach
  * GIP/GLP-1/CCK/Secretin
* Acid in the small intestine stimulates secretin production, which induces pancreatic secretion
* Fats/Proteins stimulate CCK production, pancreatic enzyme secretion (biles)
* Carbs stimulate GIP/GLP-1 (think G -> glucose) induce insulin secretion

#### Enterohepatic Circulation of Bile Salts
* Bile Salts are released into duodenum, absorbed in terminal ileum, enter portal circulation, travel back to liver
  * Bile salts circulate between liver and intestines, possibly many times during a meal

#### Summary of Secretions during Intestinal Phase
* Recall: intestines break down just about all organic molecules

#### Activation of Pancreatic Zymogens
![fig 21.17](../static/BIOL373/fig21.17b.png)
* Zymogens are secreated along with trypsinogen
* Trypsinogen is activated by enteropeptidase in brush border
* Activates trypsinogen -> trypsin
* Trypsin in turn activates the zymogens
  * Chymotrypsinogen -> Chymotrypsin
  * Procarboxypeptidase -> Carboxypeptidase
  * Procolipase -> Colipase
  * Prophospholipase -> Phospholipase

#### Absorption in Small Intestine
* Most of the fluid is absorbed in small intestine (c.f. water balance)
  * Transport of organic nutrients and ions creates an osmotic gradient
  * most absorbed nutrients move into capillaries in villi then into hepatic portal vein
  * fats go to lymphatic system
* Xenobiotics pass through liver

#### Large intestine
* Removes most of remaining water and formation of feces
* Motility
  * Much less water -> harder motility
  * Ileocecal valve (small/large intestine) relaxes each time a peristaltic wave reaches it
    * Relaxes when food leaves somach as well
  * Most of movement is segmental aside from a few mass movements
  * Peristaltic movement occurs 3-4 times a day to move bolus forwards
  * Triggers defecation reflex

#### Diarrhea
* Imbalance between intestinal absorption and secretion
  * Osmotic diarrhea
    * unabsorbed, osmotically active solutes
      * sorbitol, olestra, undigested lactose
      * Osmotic laxatives
  * Secretory Diarrhea - bacteral toxins increase Cl- secretion
    * cholera
    * can also be adaptive (flushing out infections)
* Can lead to dehydration
* metabolic acidosis
  * excess acid production
  * Bicarb from the small intestine is drained quickly

#### Cholera
* Intestinal infection
  * Contaminated food
  * Contaminated water
* Need to ingest ~100million bacteria
  * but lower doses can cause infection in immune suppressed
  * young children, reduced gastric acidity
* 100k deaths per year

#### Cholera vs. Cystic Fibrosis
* CF most common fatal, recessive single-gene disorder of northern Europeans and descendants
*Why is the frequency of this disease so high?*
* CF decreases CFTR ability, Cholera is excess CFTR activity
* CF heterozygotes have ~50% functional CFTRs
  * Enough for normal function but allows them to resist death from cholera due to reduced Cl secretion
* CFTR also involved in other diseases like typhoid, bronchia asthma
