### Gastrointestinal System
* Overview of Gastro functions:
  * Motility
    * Keeps gut contents moving
  * Secretion
    * Regulated release of enzymes into gut lumen
  * Digestion
    * Breaking down macromolecules (nutrients) into forms that can be transported across the epithelium
  * Absorption
    * Transport nutrients, water, ions, vitamins across epithelium
* Similar to kidney, need to overcome the challenge of movement across a barrier
* Tubular system, controls what enters or exits the body
* Some level of defence against entry of pathogens
  * Large class of diseases comes from food an water
  * Some sense of OK vs not OK macromolecules (pathogens are made of macromolecules)

#### Water Balance in the GI Tract
* Similar to kidneys
![fig 21.1](../static/BIOL373/fig21.1.png)
* About 9L of water is inputted into the gut lumen, all of it needs to get out (or diarrhea)
* Fluid output mostly due to the small intestine
* Large intestine removes a small amount of the water, the last bit
* Very little water is excreted from the feces

#### Gross Anatomy
![fig 21.3](../static/BIOL373/fig21.3a.png)
* Mucosa
  * Lamina propria is the innermost connective tissue laer under the epithelium
  * Innermost section, contains glands
  * Single layer
  * Muscularis Mucosa
* Submucosa
  * Nerve sections
  * Meissner's plexus
* Muscularis
  * two layers of smooth muscle
  * Circular muscle
  * Myenteric plexus
  * Longitudinal muscle
* Serosa

#### Microanatomy of the Stomach
![fig 21.3](../static/BIOL373/fig21.3b.png)
* Goal is to transport from above the Mucosa (in figure) to artery
* Mucosa contains gastric glands, folded but different from rugae

#### Small intestine Gross Anatomy
![fig 21.3](../static/BIOL373/fig21.3c.png)
* Also folded (plica), does not spread out like rugae
* Have villi on the epithelium

#### Small intestine Microanatomy
![fig 21.3](../static/BIOL373/fig21.3d.png)
* Villi at the top

#### Ideas for Anatomy
* Know the general anatomy, similarities in the tubeular cross section

#### Patterns of Gut Motility
* Perstalsis
  * Moving food from mouth to anus
* segmental Contractions
  * Mixing/Churning

#### Gut Motility
![fig 12.23](../static/BIOL373/fig12.23.png)
* Coupled by gap junctions
* Recall from BIOL273
  * single unit smooth muscle
  * Coordinated
* Tonic Contraction
  * Sphincters
  * Anterior part of stomach
  * Keeps food from moving backwards
* Can undergo phasic contractions
  * Posterior stomach, small intestine
* Between meals
  * Sweeping, phasic muscle contractions
  * Slowly moves down tract
* During meals
  * Both peristaltic and segmental contractions

#### Slow Wave Potentials
![fig 21.4](../static/BIOL373/fig21.4.png)
* Similar to cardiac muscles
* Set off by pacemaker cells
  * Less frequent, do not necessarily reach threshold
  * Below threshold -> no contraction
  * Above threshold -> open voltage gated Ca channels -> AP -> contractions
* Degree of contraction is graded
  * Longer wave more time for Ca to enter -> larger contraction
  * Influenced by hormones, NTs Paractine factors
* Slow wave frequency varies in different regions of tract
  * More frequent in duodenum instead of stomach
  * Set by pacemaker cells
    * Cajal

#### Secretion
* Water and ions secreted, then reabsorbed
  * Contribute to mucus layer
  * Help carry substances through tract (motility)
* Water and ions
  * Mostly via membrane transporter
    * Similar to kidneys
  * Water follows osmotic gradient
  * Water and ions in regions between cells occurs more often
    * paracellular
* Transporters
  * Na/K-ATPase
  * NKCC
  * Cl/HCO3 exchanger
  * Na/H exchanger
  * CFTR (new)

#### Acid Secretion
![fig 21.5](../static/BIOL373/fig21.5a.png)
* Happens by Parietal Cells
  * Looks like a tooth
  * H+ pumped into lumen by pumping in Cl in exchange for HCO3
  * HCO3 comes in from splitting H and OH
* Parietal cells secrete A LOT of H+
  * Alkaline tide
  * pH of ~1-2 in the stomach, 7 in the cell
  * Requires massive amounts of ATP

#### NaCl secretion
![fig 21.5](../static/BIOL373/fig21.5b.png)
* CFTR Channel is the driver of NaCl secretion
* NKCC from interstitial fluid
  * Na is pumped out with ATPase
  * K+ flows out from channel
* Cl and Na flows out into lumen

#### Bicarb from Pancreas into Duodenum
![fig 21.5](../static/BIOL373/fig21.5c.png)
* Bicarb secreted into duodenum neutralizes acid arriving from stomach
* Islet Cells
* Acinar cells of pancreas secrete enzyme, epithelial cells lining ducts secrete bicarb solution
  * ![fig 21.5](../static/BIOL373/fig21.5d.png)
  * Goal is to put bicarbonate into pancreatic duct
  * Requires expression of Carbonic Anhydrase
  * Similar to acid secretion, but different direction

#### CFTR
* Mucosal surface is a watery saline
* Issues with CFTR messes up watery saline production
* In the pancreas, mucus is too thick, and acinar cell groups are blocks and forms cysts
* Fibrotic tissue in acinar cells
* Causes cystic fibrosis
* Part of Cystic Fibrosis treatment is to consume digestive enzymes that would normally be produced but are blocked in the pancreas

#### Secretion of Enzymes
* Enzymes secreted by either exocrine glands (pancreas, salivary) or epithelial cells lining stomach and small intestine
  * Synthesized by rough ER, packaged by Golgi and stored in cells under signal for release
* Enzyme often linked to apical membranes by protein or lipied stalks (brush border enzymes)
* Zymogens
  * Protect from autodigestion
* Regulated by neural hormone and paracrine

#### Secretion of Mucus
* Mucus consists of mucins, mixture of glycoproteins
* Produced by exocrine cells
  * Serous cells in salivary glands
  * Mucous cells in stomach
  * Goblet cells in intestine
* Signals for secretion:
  * parasympathetic stimulation
  * various neuropeptides (of enteric nervous system)
  * cytokines (from immune cells)â€“infection and inflammation increase mucus secretiion
  * Can get inconvenient, often this aspect is messed up with diseases

#### Saliva
* Salivary glands arranged similar to exocrine pancreas
* Saliva is fairly complex, hypo-osmotic fluid
* Two step process
  * Fluid secreted by acinar cells similar to ECF
  * As it passes through ducts, epithelial cells take back Na and secrete K so eventually resembles ICF
    * duct cells have low water permeability

#### Liver Gross Anatomy
![fig 21.6](../static/BIOL373/fig21.6.png)
* The liver makes bile
* Stored in the gall bladder
* Common Hepatic duct
  * bile drainage for the entire liver
* Common bile duct
  * for liver and the gall bladder

#### Hepatic Portal System
* Liver accepts blood from the hepatic artery
* Most of the blood in the liver is from venous drainage
  * From hepatic portal vein
  * After the capillaries of GI tract, nutrients pass to liver *first*
* Liver decides what passes into the rest of the body
* (Artery blood + Portal vein blood) -> sinusoids -> central vein -> hepatic vein

#### Liver function
* Organization of Hepatic Lobule
* Blood moves from the vertices into the center of each lobule
  * Interacts with liver cells (hepatocytes)
  * Blood spaces (vessels? like a capillary bed) called sinusoids
  * Hepatocytes can build cool things to deliver to the rest of the body
  * Artery delivers blood (partially oxygenated in sinusoids, for hepatocytes)
* Bile duct also in the corners
  * Small canals to the bile ductule
  * Hepatocytes secretes bile into canals
  * Picked up and goes into ductules, which join eventually into common hepatic duct

#### Secretion of bile
* Key components of bile:
  * Bile salts (facilitate fat digestion)
  * Bile pigments (bilirubin)
  * Cholesterol
* Drugs and other xenobiotics excreted in feces

#### Overview of Liver Function
![fig-slide-32](../static//fig-slide-32.png)
* Glucose (and other metabolic nutrients) entering the GI tract can be stored as glycogen/used/exported
* Drugs (oral) enters through GI tract and liver determines if it needs to be detoxified (almost always modifies) enters bloodstream
* Drugs (intravenous/intramuscular) enters liver through hepatic artery

#### Hemoglobin, Iron processing and RBC Turnover
* Bilirubin comes from processed haemoglobin
* Kidney and liver filters bilirubin
* Breakdown of RBC produces bilirubin
  * Yellow phase of bruises
  * Jaundice (bilirubin emia)

#### Digestion and Absorption
* combination of mechanical and enzymatic processes
  * Mouth - chewing
  * Stomach, small intestine - churning
  * exposes to enzymes: saliva, stomach acids, digestive enzymes
* Absorption
  * Crossing the gut epithelium
  * very similar transport challenge to kidney
  * fat: enters lymph vessels

#### Absorption in Small Intestine
![fig 21.7](../static/BIOL373/fig21.7.png)
* Enterocyte: intestinal cell

#### Carbohydrates
* Constitute about half of caloric intake
* Mostly starches and sucrose
  * glycogen, cellulose, lactose, maltose, glucose, fructose
  * Can only be absorbed via a membrane transporter
  * Membrane transporters for monosaccharides
* Carbohydrate polymers -> amylase produces disaccharides
* maltose + sucrose + lactose -> maltase + sucrase + lactase -> glucose + glucose fructose + glucose galactose
* SGLT brings into the apical side, exits on GLUT2. GLUT5 transport fructose

#### Protein digestion
* Hydrochloric acid straightens a chain
* Endopeptidase digests internal peptide bonds
  * Pepsin in the stomach and trypsin, chymotrypsin in the pancreas helps digest
  * Endopeptidase cleaves peptides into smaller peptides
  * free amino acids and small (2-3 AA) peptides

#### Protein Absorption
* Co-transport with sodium for amino acids
* Di-tripeptides cotransport with H+
* IGs are transported via endocytosis
  * mammalian milk contains immunoglobulins
  * brief time in early development

#### Fats
* Triglycerides
  * also includes cholesterol, phospholipids, long chain fatty acids, fat soluble vitamins
* Digestion complicated by solubility issues
* Leave stomach as large droplets mixed with aqueous chyme
* Can cross membrane, but needs to be small enough to be taken across
* Bile helps emulsify

#### Bile salts
* Bile acids: Cholic acid, chenodeoxycholic acids
* Acids get modified with functional groups added
* Bile salts are inserted into the intestine
* Amphipathic, helps emulsify fats
* Contains polar side chains, orient facing the water

#### Formation of Micelles
* Formed in the small intestine
* Fats are digested into smaller components except cholesterol
* Free fatty acids inside, and can move into intestinal brush border

#### Fat Absorption
![fig 21.9](../static/BIOL373/fig21.9.png)
* Lipid components of micelles diffuse across apical membrane
* Monoglycerides and free fatty acids recombine into triglycerides in smooth ER
* Triglycerides, cholesterol, proteins from chylomicrons are packed into vesicles and exocytosed into lacteals

#### Nucleic Acids
* Nuceloprotein
  * we know how to handle protein component
  * proteases break off amino acids and leaves only nucleic acids
  * Nucleotides produce nucleosides, absorbed by Na coupled transport

#### Vitamins
* Fat soluble (A,D,E,K)
  * Absorbed in small intestine along with fats
* Water Soluble (C, B)
  * Absorbed in small intestine via membrane transporters
* Exception: Vitamin B12
  * B12 absorption is weird
  * Absorption in ileum (last section of small intestine)
  * Absorption requires protein secreted by gastric (stomach) parietal cells ('intrinsic factor')
  * Deficiency of intrinsic factor leads to B12 deficiency, but cannot be corrected by oral B12 supplementation

#### Water and Ion Balance
* Absorption of ions and water
* Small and large intestine move sodium, water and other ions follow
* Iron and Calcium is the only example of *regulated* digestion/absorption
* Apically expressed transporters to bring iron
  * Divalent Metal Transporter 1 (DMT1)
  * Iron intake is regulated
  * Intestinal uptake is increased
  * DMT1 also brings in heavy metals, including cadmium, etc
* Calcium
  * Calcium channel on apical side
  * Calcium *pump* on the basolateral side, along with calcium sodium antiporter
