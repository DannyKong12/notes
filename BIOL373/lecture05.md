# Biol 373

### Renal Function
* Study of urine was interesting to physicians
* Good indicator of many biological functions

#### Roles of the Kidney
* Regulates a number of bodily functions
  * ECF volume and blood pressure
  * plasma osmolarity
  * ion balance
  * pH balance
  * excretion of waste (nitrogenous, breakdown of hormones, haemoglobin)
  * integration of behaviour with kidney functions

#### Urinary Tract Anatomy
![fig 19.1](../static/BIOL373/fig19.1.png)
* Very integrated with blood flow
* Blood enters kidneys to be filtered
* Also requires blood flow for its own cells

#### Structure of the kidney
![fig 19.1](../static/BIOL373/fig19.1.png)
* Outer part called cortex, inner globes called medulla
* Two types of nephrons
* Cortical nephron (deep in the cortex)
* Juxtamedullary nephron (in cortex immediately below medulla)
* nephrons contains duct into renal pelvis
* Tubular structure
  * Tubing begins at a capsule (Bowman's capsules)
  * Goes into proximal tubule
  * Descends towards medulla
  * Descending/Ascending loop of henle (in medulla)
  * Ascending section passed Bowman's capsule
  * Tubing twists far from Bowman's capsule (distal tubule)
* Vasculature
  * Artery feeds into capsule (Glomerular capsule)
  * Arteriole enters into a capillary bed
  * Leaves as an arteriole
  * Peritubular capillaries
  * (Vasa recta in the juxtamedullary)
  * On unraveled nephron, veins attached to descending limb, arteries on ascending limb

#### Renal Circulation
* Kidneys process ~180L or blood per day, but only ~1.5L is excreted via urinary output
  * Vast majority of fluid is reabsorbed into the bloodstream
  * Filtration occurs when water and solutes are moved into the nephron tubules
  * Peritubular capillaries reabsorb water and some solutes
  * Certain molecules are selectively filtered

#### Kidney Function
* Bowman's Capsule
  * Filtration:
    * Water and solutes exit the bloodstream and enter the nephron tubulature
* Proximal Tubule
  * Secretion
  * Reabsorption
* Loop of Henle
  * Reabsorption
* Distal Tubule
  * Secretion
  * Reabsorption
* Collecting duct
  * Secretion and Reabsorption with vasa recta

#### Kidney Filtration
* Kidneys draw in water and solutes from bloodstream (filtrate)
* Filtered blood is roughly iso-osmotic, 180L in volume per day
* Filtrate is almost identical to bloodstream, with no blood cells and no protein

#### Secretion and Reabsorption in the Kidneys
* Proximal Tubule
  * Filtrate is reabsorbed into the bloodstream
  * Absorption is iso-osmotic (equal parts water and solute)
  * 70% of absorption occurs in the proximal tubule
* Loop of Henle
  * Water is reabsorbed, more solute gets absorbed
  * Osmolarity of filtrate decreases
  * 90% of filtrate is reabsorbed at this point
* Distal Tubule
  * Last 10% of reabsorption is variable

#### Renal Corpuscle Structure
![fig 19.5](../static/BIOL373/fig19.5.png)
* ~20% of plasma moves out of glomerular capillaries into the Bowman's capsule
* The filtration fraction is the ratio of the amount of blood plasma that enters the nephron as filtrate
* Afferent arteriole carries blood into the capsule, efferent carries the rest of the blood and unfiltered blood plasma

#### Barriers to Filtration
* Capillaries are fenestrated
* Most things are allowed to pass
* Exceptionally large things (cells) can't fit
* Proteins are repelled by proteins on pore surfaces
* Basement membrane is a layer of membrane between capillary and capsule
* Higher amount of collagen and negatively charged proteins
* blocks proteins from entering
* Epithelium is composed of podocytes with foot process that forms a mesh on top of the capillary
* Space between allows water and solutes to move, but filters proteins

#### Starling Forces
![fig 15.18](../static/BIOL373/fig15.18.png)
* In any fluid flow in a tube, there is hydrostatic pressure that moves blood out of the capillary through the fenestrations
* Trapped proteins produce an osmotic draw of water back into the capillary
* Driving force is reduced by colloid osmotic pressure and pressure of fluid inside the capsule
* Low pressure difference but high flow rate inside the blood vessel means fairly high flow into the capsule

#### Glomerular Filtration Rate
* Filtration pressure affects GFR
* Filtration coefficient - pressure -> movement
* Similar to gas exchange in the alveoli
  * barrier permeability/thickness
  * partial pressure
* Not affected by BP - why ?

#### GFR can be controlled by Arteriolar Resistance
* If the *afferent* arteriole is restricted
  * BP decreases
  * Blood flow decreases
  * Filtration rate decreases
* If the *efferent* arteriole is restricted
  * BP increases
  * Blood flow decreases
  * Filtration rate increases
* BP (hydrostatic pressure) is not necessarily correlated with systemic (body) BP

#### GFR Regulation
* Primarily regulated by
* Myogenic Response Mechanism
  * Myo - muscle
  * Genic - originating from
  * Myogenic response is a response that coordinates arteriolar smooth muscle
  * Constriction in response to BP increase, dilation in response to BP decrease
  * Very similar to vasodilation/constriction in other systemic arterioles
* Tubuloglomerular Feedback
  * Flow through the tubule influences GFR
  * Involves juxtaglomerular apparatus
  * Two types of cells here are different
    * Tubular epithelium near the arteriole is different (makes up the macula densa)
    * Arteriole epithelium is also different, specialized smooth muscle cells called granular cells
  * Macula densa signals to afferent smooth muscle - induces contraction
  * Pathway:
    ![fig 19.7](../static/BIOL373/fig19.7.png)
    * Increase in GFR increases salt flow past the macula densa
    * paracrine signalling to smooth muscle - contraction
    * decreases GFR
* Autonomic effects on GFR
  * Affects GFR in extreme conditions
    * Bleeding, dehydration
    * Sharp drop in BP/BV -> systemic vasoconstriction
* Endocrine effects on GFR
  * Angiotensin II is a vasoconstrictor
  * Prostaglandins are a vasodilator
  * Affects GFR by changing the arterioles, also the podocytes that make up the mesh
