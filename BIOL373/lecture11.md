### Metabolism and Energy Balance

#### Homeostatic vs. non-Homeostatic Eating
* Homeostatic:
  * Eating when energy fuels are depleted
  * Not eating when energy fuels are sufficient
  * "metabolically driven"
* Non-Homeostatic:
  * Eating in the complete absence of hunger
  * Eating despite large fat reserves
    * Involves cognitive, reward, emotional factors
    * has neural parallels with addiction mechanisms

#### Models for Regulation of Homeostatic Eating
* Two centers in the hypothalamus
  * Hunger center
  * Satiety center
* Glucosatic theory
  * Intake regulated by glucose levels, monitored in hypothalamus
* Lipostatic theory
  * Signal from fat stores to brain modulates eating behaviour
  * Discovery of protein hormone synthesized in white adipose tissue

#### Leptin and the ob/ob Mouse
* In the 1950s, discovered spontaneous mutation in mouse colony at lab animal supplier
  * Mice were obese, voracious eaters
* Mutation was identified with the 'ob' gene
  * 'ob/ob' mouse name arose
* the protein product of the gene was leptin
* Another mutation discovered 'db' mutation in the leptin receptor
* Circulating leptin concentrations may affect eating habits

#### Signals from Gut can Regulate Homeostatic Eating
* Stomach can increase appetite by producing ghrelin
* Stomach distension and increased acid signals for decreased appetite
* Upper small intestine increase CCK in response to fat/proteins
* Increased glucose in lumen (pathway is uncertain)
* Lower small intestine produces peptide YY and GLP 1

#### Peptides that Influence Homeostatic Eating
* Neuropeptide Y
  * Key NT in the stimulation of appetite
  * Many hormones, neuropeptides and produces of adipocytes interact to influence appetite
  * Fairly complex and poorly understood

#### Homeostatic Regulation of Metabolism
* metabolism: "set of life-sustaining chemical transformation within cellso f living organisms"
* Whether transformation of energy substrates (carbs fats proteins) will go towards storage/anabolism or breakdown/catabolism
* Regulation
  * Endocrine
    * products of endocrine pancreas
    * insulin/glucagon ration
  * Neural - regulation of food intake

#### Endocrine Pancreas
* Islets of Langerhans
  * Bundles of cells not connected to exocrine acinar cells
* Consists of 3 types, alpha/beta, D
* Apha cell produces Glucagon
* Beta cell produces insulin
* D cell produces somatostatin

#### Fed vs Fasted states
* Fed (absorptive) vs Fasted (postabsorptive) states are decided by hormones
* Insulin
  * increases glucose oxidation
  * increases glycogen synthesis
  * increases fat synthesis
  * increases protein synthesis
* Glucagon
  * Increases glycogenolysis
  * Gluconeogensis
  * Ketogenesis

#### Insulin Secretion and Action
* Factors affecting insulin release
  * Increased plasma glucose (> 100mg/dL, fasting is 90)
  * Increased plasma AAs
  * GLP-1, GIP increase
* Targets
  * striated muscle, adipose tissue (that express GLUT4)
  * Liver
* Action
  * Glucose transport into GLUT4 expressing cells
  * Glucose metabolism
  * Glycogenesis
  * Fat synthesis, protein synthesis

#### Fed State Insulin
![fig 22.15](../static/BIOL373/fig22.15.png)
* Various pathways from eating causes Insulin release
* Action is to ultimately reduce plasma glucose

#### Features of Pancreatic Beta Cells
* GLUT2 transporters move glucose into beta cells by facilitated diffusion
* K+ leak channels, close when ATP binds to them "ATP-gated" channel
* voltage gated Ca channels
* Secretory vesicles of insulin waiting for release signal
* At rest, the K leak channels set membrane potential, Ca channel closed
* When K channels close, cell depolarizes and Ca enters

#### How does the insulin receptor work
* Enzyme coupled RTK
* When activated, RTKs transfer phosphate groups from ATP to tyrosine on target proteins
  * Insulin binds, $\beta$-subunits phosphorylate themselves
  * activated RTKs phosphorylates target proteins
  * Cell reponses

#### Insulin mechanism of Action
![fig 22.16](../static/BIOL373/fig22.16.png)

#### Insulin effects in Muscle and Adipose Tissue
* Insulin receptor sends a signal cascade in cell, which installs GLUT4 in muscle and adipose

#### Insulin effects in Hepatocytes
* during low blood glucose conditions, hepatocytes make glucose and export it
* during high blood glucose conditions, hepatocytes *import* glucose using the same GLUT2 transporter
* Activates hexokinase -> phosphorylated glucose, which reduces free glucose levels

#### Insulin as an Anabolic pathway
* Activates enzymes that enhance
  * glycolysis
  * glycogenesis
  * AA utilization
  * Lipogenesis
* Inhibits enzymes that enhance
  * gluconeogenesis
  * Glycogenolysis
  * Proteolysis
  * Lipolysis
  * $\beta$ oxidation of fatty acids

#### Glucagon antagonizes effects of insulin
* produced by alpha cells of pancreas
* Member of secretin family of peptides
* Main trigger is low blood glucose
* Main target is liver
* acts via GPCR, cAMP
* Main function is to prevent hypoglycemia
* During overnight fast, 75% of glucose from the liver comes from glycogenolysis, 25% from gluconeogenesis

#### Endocrine response to Hypoglycemia
![fig 22.18](../static/BIOL373/fig22.18.png)
* Low glucose is detected by pancreatic $\alpha$ cells
* Produces glucagon which stimulates targets
* Net target is higher blood glucose

#### Diabetes Mellitus
* Group of diseases characterized by elevated blood glucose
  * can result from inadequate insulin secretion
  * Abnormal target cell responsiveness

#### Acute pathophysiology of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus
fig ???
* basically figure suggests no insulin is being released from fat/protein/glucose metabolism
* Eventually ends in hyperglycemia
  * Causes metabolic acidosis
  * Dehydration
  * Various systemic outcomes

#### Type 2 Diabetes
* Accounts for 90% of diabetes
* Typically there is a "insulin resistance"
  * delayed response to oral glucose
  * Can be coupled with low, normal, or high insulin secretion
* Acute symptoms not as severe as Type 1
* Type 2 diabetes, atherosclerosis and hypertension tend to occur together
  * Hypertension
  * high fasting blood glucose
  * elevated fasting triglycerides

#### Appetite Control and Metabolic Regulation in the Modern World
* Humans have significant energy stores
  * Can go long without food
  * Food restriction and fat use leads to hunger
  * Effector mechanisms that are adaptible, flexible and learn from experience
* Emerged evolutionarily from constant struggle to find food for survival, *using* fat stores sends low food alarm -> find more food

#### Modern Humans
* Environment acts on higher brain regions to overstimulate food intake
* Procuring food is no longer demanding or dangerous, don't need as much stimulation from homestatic hunger
* Exceeding upper limits of body weight is not a disadvantage in terms of predator-prey relationships
  * no selection for leanness
* Leptin resistance
  * happens to animals when exposed to human diets
  * Leptin resistance occurs so animals can overeat to build up stores (ie for winter)

#### Leptin Deficiencies in humans
* Frame shift mutation in lep gene
* Five other cases

#### Adrenal Gland
* Ad-renal "on the kidneys", same as epi-nephros
![fig 23.1](../static/BIOL373/fig23.1.png)
* Three main zones producing endocrine hormones
  * Aldosterones produced (mineralo)
  * cortisol, corticosteroids
  * sex steroids

#### Steroidogenic Pathway
* Cholesterol with a cleaved side chain is the precursor to steroids

#### Hypothalamic Pituitary Adrenal Axis
![fig 23.2](../static/BIOL373/fig23.2.png)
* Hypothalamus controlled by a number of aspects, including circadian rhythm
  * Low blood glucose
* Targets Liver/Muscles/Adipose tissue
  * Pushes tissue groups for energy
  * produces glucose for energy

#### Cortisol is secreted in a circadian rhythm

#### Targets of Glucocorticoids
* Receptors expressed by all nucleated cells
* Long term (genomic) effects
  * Increased expression of enzymes
  * Increased expression of receptors for other regylatory hormones
* Drives enzymatic expression
  * to carry out metabolic effects (hypoglycemia)
  * Generate glucose in blood
* Suppress immune response

#### Stress Axis
* Hans Selye
* Built on walk of Claude Bernard, Water Cannon
  * Developed concept that a wide variety of stressors (harmless, noxious, positive, negative) causing a generic response
    * Adrenal Hypertrophy
    * Atrophy of thymus/lymph nodes
    * GI ulcers
  * Failure to cope with/adapt to stresses caused diseases of adaptation (ulcers, hypertension, etc)
  * Was working with rats, injected certain compounds he considered to be stressors
    * yet, all the animals, including the control, had the same symptoms
    * The stress of the procedure of testing the animals was producing symptoms
    * Stress leads to generic responses
* Led to many breakthroughs in hypothalamic-pituitary axis

#### Epinephrine + Fight or Flight response
* NE released from post-ganglionic neurons
* E released from adrenal medulla
  * Rapid effects with very short half-lives
* Various effects throughout body
* Metabolic effects: mobilize energy substrates
  * decrease insulin release + increase glucagon release
  * adpiose -> lipogenesis
  * muscle -> glycogenolysis
  * liver -> glycogenolysis, gluconeogenesis
* Acts like glucagon, but on a variety of target tissues

#### Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers
* Supression of immune system to prevent energy waste
* Don't need to worry about bacterial infection when muscles need energy to literally "run from the lion"

#### glucagon and epinephrine and cortisol
![fig 7.12](../static/BIOL373/fig7.12.png)
* Cortisol allows glucagon and epinephrine to fully effect

#### Cortisol Pathologies
* Hypercortisolism - Cushing's Syndrome
  * Primary - Cortisol-secreting adrenal tumors (not regulated by ACTH)
  * Secondary - pituitary tumor that over-secretes ACTH
  * Iatrogenic - secondary to cortisol therapy for other conditions
* Hypocortisolism
  * Primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison's Disease)
    * Adrenal Gland does not develop normally
    * mutations in key steroidogenic enzymes
    * Adrenal Gland damaged (autoimmune)
    * Produces Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia
  * Secondary
    * Lack of ACTH

#### Thyroid Gland
![fig 23.4](../static/BIOL373/fig23.4.png)
* Located just under the larynx, around the trachea
* Bulbous, made of capsules of connective tissue
* capsules themselves contain follicles
* Follicles made up of cells that produce thyroid hormones
* Adjacent to many follicles are C-cells which produce Calcitonin

#### Thyroid Hormone
![fig 23.5](../static/BIOL373/fig23.5.png)
* Tyrosine derived Hormones
* Catecholamines produced by modifying side groups of tyrosine
* Thyroid hormones are synthesized from two tyrosines and iodine (4)
* Circulate in blood usually in T4 form, activated in T3 form

#### Actions of Thyroid Hormones
* Essential for normal growth/development especiall nervous system
  * In children, severe developmental effects
  * In adults, not essential but affects quality of life
* Main function is to provide substrates for oxidative metabolism

#### Thyroid Pathologies
* Hypothyroidism
  * Diminished oxygen consumption, decreased metabolic rate
  * Neurological effects, fatigue
  * Effects on skin nails hair
* Hyperthyroidism
  * Increased oxygen consumption, heat production
  * muscle weakness
  * neurological, cardiac effects
  * exophthalmos

#### Growth Hormone (GH, somatotropin) axis
![fig 23.8](../static/BIOL373/fig23.8.png)
* control of growth depends on many factors
  * GH, plus many other hormones playing direct and permissive roles
    * Insulin, thyroid hormone, sex steroids
  * Adequate nutrition
  * Absence of chronic stress
  * genetics

#### Action of Growth Hormone
* Carbohydrate - indirect effects lead to increase plamsa glucose
* Fat - lipulysis and oxidation
* Protein - *increases* protein creation
  * anabolic to proteins

#### Growth Hormone Pathologies
* Deficiency due to GH hyposecretion, GH receptor mutations
  * Dwarfism though GH issues are not a common cause
* Excess depends on whether excess secretion is before or after closure of growth plates of long bones
  * Before - giantism
  * After - acromegaly
* Deficiency syndromes were difficult to treat when the only source of human GH was cadavers
* Availability of bioengineered human GH has raised ethical issues
  * Fine determinism of "how tall enough"

* Chondrocytes multiply and grow
  * Osteoblasts invades space where chondryctes die and lays down calcium
* Osteoclasts - large multinucleate cells derived from hematopoietic stem cells
  * Dissolve bones and pulls Calcium in

#### Calcium intake
* Calcium absorption *can* be regulated by Vitamin $D_3$, and
* Calcium reabsorption at the kidneys is regulated at the distal nephron only
* Parathyroid hormone regulates Calcium
![fig 7.7](../static/BIOL373/fig7.7.png)
* Parathyroid hormone detects low plasma Ca
  * Increased reabsorption at kidneys
  * Increased osteoclast activity
  * Increased (transcellular) Ca absorption at kidneys

#### Calcium Homeostasis
* The small amount of calcium in the ECF is regulated
* From Small intestine:
  * Some is absorbed directly into ECF, trans cellular transporters can be regulated
* At the kidneys:
  * Freely filtered
  * mostly reabsorbed, can be regulated
* Bones:
  * Build bones
    * Osteoblasts
  * Resorption
    * Osteoclasts
