### Reproduction
* Genetic (Chromosomal) Sex
* Having Sry, sex determination

#### Steps in Sexual Differentiation
* Build indifferent gonads
* Differentiate gonads down either male or female pathway
  * requires expression of master gene on Y chromosomes *Sry*
    * Testes: germ cell precursors plus two major somatic cell types
      * Leydig Cells, Sertoli cells
* Build appropriate ductwork for internal transport of gametes
  * Built from components of urinary tract (mesonephric duct)
  * Build from paramesonephric duct
    * Mesonephric - Wolffian
    * paramesonephric - Mullerian
* Requires action of testosterone from Leydig Cells (to support male tract) and Anti Mullerian Hormone to regress mullerian duct
* Build appropriate appropriate external genitalia


#### Urinary and Reproductive Systems are Inter-Related
* early gestation produces pronephros
* Mesonephros + mesonephric kept in males
* paramesonephric duct kept in females and lost in males

#### Development of internal Genitalia
* Male
  * Wolffian duct
    * Dpididymis
    * Vas deferens
    * Accessory sex glands
* Female
  * Mullerian derivatives
    * Oviducts (fallopian tubes)
    * Uterus
    * Cervix
    * Upper vagina

#### Signalling involved in Reproductive Development
* Begin by building bipotential gonad
  * germ cell precursors arrive, somatic cells organize around them
* If somatic cells express Sry
  * Testis
    * Spermatogonia
    * Sertoli cells -> AMH -> regress mullerian
    * Leydig cells -> Testosterone
* No Sry
  * Ovary
    * oogonia -> oocytes
    * Granulosa cells -> no AMH -> retain mullerian
    * Theca cells -> no Testosterone -> wolffian regresses

#### Steroidogenic Pathway Revisited (again)
* Recall functions of some enzymes
  * 5$\alpha$-reductase takes Testosterone -> DHT
  * 21-hydroxylase takes Progesterone -> Coricosterone/cortisol
  * Aromatase takes Adione/Testosterone -> Esterone/Estradiol

#### Gametogenesis
* Timeline of germ cell/gamete development is different in males vs females

#### In females:
* Mitosis in stem cells (oogonia) starts and ends in fetal life
* Fetal ovary
  * Eggs enter meiosis, arrest in meiosis I
  * Born with all the oocytes they will ever have
* When follicle/egg selected for ovulation, meiosis I completed then meiotic arrest (again)
* Meiosis II completed only if oocyte is fertilized

#### In males:
* Mitosis in stem cells (spermatogonia) begins at puberty
* Complete meiosis and differentiation into functional sperm without arrest
* Male germ cells can undergo mitosis/meiosis throughout life

#### Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Gonadal Axis
![fig 26.6](../static/BIOL373/fig26.6.png)
* CNS integrates internal and environmental stimuli
* Hypothalamus releases Gonadotropin-releasing hormone
* Anterior pituitary gland releases Luteinizing hormone and follicle stimulating hormone
* LH act on endocrine cells in gonads and produce steroid and peptide hormones, infemales act on gamete production
* FSH activates gamete production

#### Feedback Regulation by Gonadal Steroids
* Main hormone product of testes is testosterone
  * Peripheral conversion into DHT
* Main hormone product of ovaries is estradiol and progesterone
* Gonadal steroids mediate negative feedback at hypothalamus and anterior pituitary with the exception of extradiol under certain conditions
  * sustained high levels of estradiol will cause massive surge release of LH/FS

#### Male Reproductive System
* Testicular migration in to scrotal sac is a feature of some species of mammals
  * Androgen-dependent
  * Normal spermatogenesis in these species require slightly lower body temperature
  * Failure to descend = cryptorchidism

#### Testes
* Composed of 3 main parts
  * Seminiferous tubules
  * Epididymis
  * Vas deferens

#### Spermatogenesis
* Spermatogonia - mitotic cells
* Primary spermatocytes are cells that have entered meiosis 1
* Secondary spermatocytes have entered meiosis II
* Spermatids completed meiosis but have not undergone cell remodelling
* Basal lamina
  * Cells associated with basal lamina have tight junctions between sertoli cells and form the blood-testes barrier

#### Spermatozoan
* From sermatogonium to release into the lumen of the tubule, takes 64 days

#### Endocrine Control of Spermatogenesis
* Recall: role of FSH, LH in spermatogenesis
  * Follicle Stimulating Hormone induces spermatogenesis
  * Lutenizing Hormone indirectly induces spermatogenesis through testosterone

#### Effects of Testicular Androgens
* Negative feedback control of LH/FSH and GnRH
  * Short loop feedback from pituitary to hypotahlamus
* Primary sex characteristics
  * Development and maintainance of internal and external genitalia
  * Support of spermatogenesis
* Secondary sexual characterisitics
  * Including protein synthesis, muscle growth
* behavioural effects
* Main secreted steroid is testosterone but often converted in target tissues to DHT

#### Female Reproductive System
* Metrium means uterus
* Endometrium consists of the glandular epithelium and the lamina propria
* Myometrium - uterus smooth muscle

#### Ovarian Structures
* Maturing follicles have a clear oocyte
* Follicle ruptures, and leaves an oocyte
* The corpus luteum develops from ruptured follicle
  * Invovled in producing progsterone, and some estradiol
  * Regresses if pregnancy does not occur

#### Phases of Menstrual Cycle
* main product of follicle is estradiol
* main product of corpus luteum is progesterone
* Follicular Phase
  * Surplus of estradiol compared to progesterone
  * Several days of exposure produces wave of gonadotrophin
  * LH surge is the signal to ovulate the follicle, and maturing follicle causes it's own ovulation
  * Follicle controls it's own timing
  * In the uterus, endometrial lining shed due to steroid withdrawal -> menses phase
  * Rising estrogen from maturing follicle stimulates regrowth of lining
* Ovulation marks transition to Luteal phase
* Luteal Phase
  * At the LH surge, ovulation is triggered
  * Ovary releases oocyte, completes meiosis I and arrests in meiosis II
  * Somatic cells of ovulatory follicle transform into luteal cells, form solid structure (CL)
  * Ovarian steroids suppress gonadotropins, preventing growth of large follicles
  * In the absence of pregnancy, luteal regression occurs after 12 days
  * uterus begins to prepare for pregnancy in the secretory phase
  * Luteal regression fails to produce steroids and goes into menses

#### Timing of Fertilization, Early cleavage, Implantation
* Inner cell mass and trophectoderm are the first differentiated cell types in mammalian embryo
* Inner cell mass will give rise to embryo proper
* trophectoderm will give rise to all extra-embryonic membranes, ie placenta

#### Fertilization
* Sperm
  * Undergo changes as they travel through female tract
    * vagina -> cervix -> uterus -> oviduct
  * After arrival at oocyte, it must penetrate layer of granulosa cells and glycoprotein layer (zona pellucida)
* oocyte
  * at this point, has completed meiosis I, arrested part way into meiosis II
* Sperm + Oocyte
  * Fusion of membranes activates oocyte triggering completion of meiosis II
    * Followed by syngamy with sperm and preparation for first mitotic division
      * Dipoloidy is re-established

#### Parturition
* cervical softening (ripening)
* Initiation of rhythmic uterine contractions
* delivery of the baby
* expulsion of the placenta
* controlled by sequential cascade of hormones
  * considerable variation among species of mammals
* only consistent trait is positive feedback and neuroendocrine reflex with oxytocin

#### Labour (Heidi's fave example of positive feedback)
* Cervical flex stimulates oxytocin release
* Causes uterine contractions which pushes the baby against cervix
* Causese more cervical stretch
* Positive loop doesn't end until delivery
