# Biol 373

### Fluid and Electrolyte Balance
* Homeostasis of
  * Na, Cl, K, H, Ca, HPO4, HCO3
* Kidney is major route of elimination but also sweat feces lungs
* Behavioural mechanisms
  * thirst
  * Salt appetite

#### Responses to Changes in BP
* Blood pressure/Blood volume decreases have mechanisms
  * Baroreceptor reflex
  * Quick vasoconstriction
  * Behavioural responses (thirst)
  * Kidneys
    * Conserve water, minimizes other volume loss
* Water Balance
  * Urine is an easily regulated water loss system, compared to loss through sweat/humidity in breath

#### Urine regulation in Nephrons
* Distal tubule "decides" how much water is being excreted
* Kidneys excrete urine at different osmolarities
  * Eliminate excess water (diuresis, diuretic)
    * 50 mOsM
  * Conserve water (antidiuretic)
    * 1200 mOsM
* Membrane permeability to water
  * Water is permeable in membrane
  * Water "leaks" through lipid bilayer, but isn't very fast
  * Channels (Aquaporins)
    * Allow much higher rate of water movement across membrane
    * Water movement regulated by regulation of expression of aquaporins
    * TODO: regulation
  * Permeability to water is adjusted at the collecting duct
    * Most of the water is reabsorbed prior to the collecting duct
    * Permeability is "fine tuned"

#### Permeability of Distal Nephron
* Regulated via hormones, induces expression of aquaporins
* Regulatory hormone antidiuretic hormone (ADH) or vasopressin (AVP)
* High vasopressin allows for water to move out of collecting duct
* Low vasopressin does not express vasopressin, dilute urine
* Aquaporins and produced and stored in vesicles

#### AVP insertion mechanism
* AVP binds to V2 receptor, cAMP activates second messenger system and aquaporins added via exocytosis
* Endocytosis remvoes aquaporins from membrane
* "Membrane cycling"

#### AVP Synthesized by Magnocellular Nephron

#### Vasopressin release
* Plasma osmolarity increase
  * Too much solute (salt) in plasma
  * Increasing water retension helps correct osmolarity
* Low blood volume/pressure

#### Homeostasis of Osmolarity
* Osmolarity affects cell size and shape
  * Physical integrity of cells
  * Ionic strength, activity of macromolecules
* Osmolarity fluctuate (normal variation 1-3%)
  * Variations in water intake / water loss
  * variation in sodium intake

#### Osmoreceptors
* Stretch sensitive neurons with mechanoreceptors
  * Osmolarity increase makes the cell hypertonic, cell shrinks, higher action potentials

#### peripheral Osmoreceptors
* Oropharyngeal cavity (back of mouth/throat)
* In blood vessels that collect solutes
  * Gastric intake decreases AVP

#### Central Osmoreceptors
* Circumventricular organs
  * Organum vasculosum laminae terminalis (OVLTs)
  * Subfornical organ
* Supraoptic nucelus in hypothalamus
  * Same neurone that releases AVP senses osmolarity in CNS

#### Circadian rhythm of AVP secretion
* Nightly increase in vasopressin
* Urine osmolarity increases in the night
* Urine volume low
* Failure to increase vasopressin at night
  * Nocturnal Enuresis
  * Developmentally, a change in vasopressin release at night

#### Countercurrent Renal Medulla
* Countercurrent vasa recta capillary along loop of Henle
  * Descending limb permeable to water (aquaporin)
  * Ascending limb no aquaporins but pumps Na, K, Cl

#### Ion Transport in Ascending Limb
* NKCC symporter (moves one Na, K, 2 Cl)
* Secondary active transport
* Water cannot follow solute
* K, Cl leave basolateral side via cotransporters/open channels
  * Drugs that affect NKCC expression, loop diuretics
* Creates the salt gradient for collecting duct

#### Why is the loop of Henle a loop?
* Salt is pumped out of the ascending limb
* Descending limb - water is drawn out by salty interstitium

#### Defense of Osmolarity
* Sodium
  * Typical American diet contains 9g of sodium per day
  * Kidneys need to clear salt (or intake 1.1L of extra water)
  * Kidneys is responsible for majority of sodium excretion
  * Cl is not directly regulated, but uses symports and electrochemical gradient

#### Homeostatic Response to Salt Ingestion
![fig 20.8](../static/BIOL373/fig20.8.png)
* 70% is reabsorbed in proximal tubule (iso-osmotic)
* 25% is reabsorbed in loop of Henle
* Regulated at distal nephron (last 5% is regulated, like water)
  * Regulated by aldosterone
  * Synthesized on demand by adrenal cortex
  * acts via intracellular receptors
  * drives transcription of protein pumps, modifies existing pumps
  * Influences upstream events
* TODO ALDOSTERONE

#### Water and Sodium
* Most of reabsorption at proximal tubule ~70%
  * ENaC, Na-K-ATPase, water follows
* Rest of absorption mostly in loop of Henle
  * Sodium - ascending, NKCC
  * Water - descending, passive osmosis
* Last bit ~5% is regulated, at distal nephron
* Water - AVP, aquaporins
* Na - increased activity and expression of pumps
  * Na-K-ATPase
  * regulated by aldosterone

#### Aldosterone Secretion
* Primary action of aldosterone is Na reabsorption (last 5%)
* Plasma potassium -> hyperkalemia
* Blood pressure (complex pathway)
![fig 20.9](../static/BIOL373/fig20.9.png)

#### Potassium Homeostasis
* Most of potassium is inside cells, not much in ECF
* ECF concentration must be fairly constant, important for membrane potentials
* Hyperkalemia makes cells depolarized, arrhythmia
* Hypokalemia makes cells hyperpolarized, muscle weakness

#### RAS pathway
* Stands for renin-angiotensin system
* angiotensinogen -> inactive angiotensin
* renin converts into angiotensin i (at JGA)
* angiotensin converter enzyme converts to angiotensin ii
* angiotensin causes aldosterone production
* aldosterone acts on kidneys

#### RAS Activation
* Started by renin made from JG cells
* JG cells monitor blood pressure
* decrease in BP -> renin
* paracrine feedback from macula densa
  * flow rate
* Sympathetic pathways from cardio control in medulla end in JG cells

#### Angiotensin II mechanism
![fig 20.10](../static/BIOL373/fig20.10.png)
* Blocking angiotensin II is of great interest for treating hypertension
  * ACE inhibitors
  * angiotensin receptor blockers
  * renin inhibitors

#### Opposing AVP and aldosterone
* Both increase BP/BV
* ANP - endrogenous RAS inhibitors
  * Atrial Natriuretic Peptide
  * produced in myocardial cells, mostly in the atria
  * increased cell stretch -> fill and pressure
![fig 20.11](../static/BIOL373/fig20.11.png)

#### Behavioural Mechanisms for Salt
* Replacing water
  * triggered by osmoreceptors
  * Angiotensin acting on hypothalamus
  * drinking water corrects thirst, not osmolarity balance, same way that drinking decreases water retension
* Replacing salt
  * "salt appetite" analogue of thirst
  * Low sodium triggers
  * linked to Na balance
![fig 20.12](../static/BIOL373/fig20.12.png)

#### Acid Base Balance - why it's necessary
* Normal plasma pH is between 7.38-7.42
  * That's an exceptionally small range
  * fluids outside the body can have highly varying pH, ie in the GI tract, renal tubules, etc
* H+ concentration needs to be closely regulated
  * impacts tertiary protein structure and therefore enzyme function
* Abnormal pH affects the nervous system
  * Acidosis - neurons become less excitable
  * alkalosis - hyperexcitable
* pH disturbances are associated with K+ disturbances
  * Due to H/K-ATPase
  * antiporters in acidosis reabsorbs K

#### Primary source of H+
* Comes from CO2 dissolved in water
  * CO2 + H20 <-> HCO3- + H+
* the more we breathe (aerate) drive reaction to the left
* holding our breath drives reaction to the right
* dealing with the acid produced by cellular respiration is important
* reaction occurs particularly quickly in cells with high levels of carbonic anhydrase
  * ie RBCs and renal epithelial cells

#### Components of pH Hemostasis
* Bicarbonate buffers
  * chemical buffers are effective against a fairly large range of concentrations
* Ventilation
  * Fast
  * Corrects large disturbances, (75%) by actually flushing out the CO2
  * Same mechanism that causes some disturbances (not breathing, not exhaling)
* Renal regulation
  * slow but effective
  * Directly excreting H+
  * Changing the rate at which HCO3 is reabsorbed or excreted, affects the amount of buffer available

#### pH homeostasis mechanism
* Buffering is the first line of defense
  * Can quickly get overwhelmed, but can fix/reduce the variance of day to day pH differences
* If buffering is overwhelmed, respiratory and renal mechanisms pick up
* If the primary cause is respiratory, renal mechanisms need to be able to fix
* If the primary cause is not respiratory, ie metabolic, both can be used
  * Think when you pant after exercise, lactic acid buildup overwhelms buffer

#### Ventilations as a pH balancing mechanism
* key reaction is still
  * CO2 + H2O <-> H2CO3 <-> HCO3 + H
* Hypoventilate -> acidosis
* Hyperventilate -> alkalosis

#### Respiratory Compensation for Acidosis
* Hypoventilation makes you less efficient in clearing CO2
* Elevated CO2 and elevated H go together
* Chemoreceptors that sense plasma pH (central and aortic) and ones that sense plasma CO2 (central) get the same signal
* drive respiration trigger ventilation muscles (diaphragm) to breathe harder and faster
* Plasma CO2 concentration and H+ goes down

#### Renal Compensation for Acidosis
* Cells in the renal tubular epithelium express Carbonic Anhydrase
* Generally, want to excrete H+ and reabsorb HCO3 to treat acidosis, vice versa for alkalosis
* Can also use reactions with amino acids to produce NH4 which uses up one H+

#### Reactions in Renal Acid-Base Mechanisms
* acidosis
  * Move H+/NH4+ into tubule
    * Apical Na/H exchanger NHE
    * Apical Na/NH4 antiporter
    * Apical H-ATPase
    * Apical H/K-ATPase
  * Move HCO3 into interstitium
    * Basolateral Na/HCO3 symporter
    * Basolateral Cl/HCO3 antiporter
* alkalosis
  * Move HCO3 into tubule
    * Apical Cl/HCO3 antiporter
  * Move H+/NH4 into interstitium
    * Basolateral H-ATPase
    * Basolateral H/K-ATPase
* default is to remove some acid from the proximal tubule and produce HCO3 as buffer
* homeostatic effects can crank up the transporters

#### Compensation Mechanisms at Tubular Segments
* Huge amounts of bicarb is filtered at the glomerulus
  * Proximal tubule reabsorbs most of it to maintain buffering capacity
  * Reabsorbed as CO2, since no HCO3 on apical side
  * converted using CA in lumen and then transported out
* Fine tuning is done in the distal nephron
  * uses two types of cells, intercalated cells A/B
  * A cells treat Acidosis
  * B cells treat Alkalosis
