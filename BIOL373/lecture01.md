### Some review
#### Homeostatic Controls
* Homeostasis is the maintenance of a relatively stable internal environment
  * Involves oscillation around a set point
  ![fig 1.4](../static/BIOL373/fig1.4.png)
* Walter Cannon
  * coined the term homeostasis
  * "wisdom of the body"
  * homeostatic responses
* the study of homeostatic mechanisms IS physiology
* disease is a failure of homeostasis

#### Local vs Reflex controls
* Example: the baroreceptor response
  * ![fig 1.8](../static/BIOL373/fig1.8.png)
  * Systemic change in blood pressure detected by baroreceptors
  * Brain evaluates change and initiates response
  * Coordinated response
  * response is reflex

#### Control systems and homeostasis
* Recall the response loop:
  * stimulus, sensor, input signal, integrating center, output, signal, target, response
* Feedback mechanisms are categorized
  * Negative feedback returns a variable to a set point
  * Feedforward tries to anticipate future changes
  * Positive feedback brings a variable to a new set point

#### Cell to Cell communication
* Cell to cell communication is required for coordinated cell actions
* Homeostatic control occurs through long range communication
  * Electrical signals (Action potentials)
  * Chemical signals (endocrine)

#### Endocrine system
* The cell can distribute signalling mechanisms in a single heartbeat

#### Neural and Neuro endocrine
![fig 6.1](../static/BIOL373/fig6.1.png)
* Signal can be as long as neurone or neurone systems

#### What defines a target cell
![fig 6.3](../static/BIOL373/fig6.3.png)
* Target cells
* Types of membrane receptors

#### Modulation of Signal Pathways
* One ligand may have multiple types of receptors on different cell types (e.g. epinephrine)
* Adrenergic receptors responds in different ways
  * $\alpha$-receptor results in vasoconstriction
  * $\beta$-receptors results in vasodilation
  * Expression of different receptors results in selective vasodilation/constriction in vessels in different sections of the body
* Receptors exhibit saturation, specificity, and competition for the ligands
* Cells can change their response to signals by changing receptors, in number or sensitivity
* The result is target cells can change their response to signalling molecules

#### Drugs and Diseases Can Affect Signalling Pathways
  (Lodish et all Molecular Cell Biology 4th edition Fig 20-17)
* Hormone binds to GPCR
* G activates adenylyl cyclase
* Cholera toxin slows GTPase activity

#### Homeostatic Reflex Pathways
* Cannon's postulates:
  * The nervous system has a role in maintaining 'fitness' of the internal environment
  * Some systems are under tonic control (controlled by changes in signal rate)
  * Some systems are under antagonistic (controlled by competing factors)
  * One chemical signal can have different effects in different tissues
* Steps of a Reflex Pathway
  * Stimulus $\rightarrow$ Sensor $\rightarrow$ Afferent Pathways $\rightarrow$ Integrating Center $\rightarrow$ Efferent $\rightarrow$ Target $\rightarrow$ Response
  * "receptor" can refer to anything from a protein in membrane/cytosol or organs like ears are receptors for hearing, peripheral receptors like baroreceptors etc
  * Simple Neural Reflex loop
