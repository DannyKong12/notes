### Special Senses

#### Olfaction (Smell)
![fig 10.13](../static/BIOL373/fig10.13.png)
* Olfactory neurons in olfactory epithelium
* The only sensory modality that does not go through thalamus and does not cross midline

#### Olfactory Pathway
* Olfactory nerves in epithelium squeeze through bone plate
* Bipolar neurons
* Cilia at end nose side, in mucus
* Olfactory bulb holds secondary neurons

#### Olfactory Receptor Neurons
* Dendrites end in non-motile cilia which express odorant receptor proteins
* Odorant receptors are GPCRs
* Each neuron expresses only one of thousands of receptors

#### Coding of Olfactory 'Quality'
* Each ORN expresses only one receptor, but odorants can stimulate many
* Very nuanced in shape of organic molecule
* Subtle differences in molecular shape can be differentiated

#### Gustation
* Combination of five basic tastes
  * Sweet $\rightarrow$ Carbs
  * Sour $\rightarrow$ $H^+$
  * Salty $\rightarrow$ $Na^+$
  * Bitter $\rightarrow$ Bitter, Hops IPA
  * Umami $\rightarrow$ Protein
* Taste replaced every 10 days

#### Taste buds
* Housed in different structures
* Buds themselves are clusters of taste receptor cells for various tastes
* Modified epithelial cells
![fig 10.14](../static/BIOL373/fig10.14.png)
* Ligand activates GPCR on taste receptor cell
* Various intracellular pathways activated
* Calcium signal triggers exocytosis of ATP
* ATP is released

#### Taste Pathways
* Taste travels through one of two nerves to medulla, thalamus, gustatory cortex

#### Hearing and equilibrium
* Signal transduction in hair cells
![fig 10.19](../static/BIOL373/fig10.19.png)
* Ciliated at the top
* Tonically active, even when not bent
* One direction increases, other direction decreases

#### Anatomy of the Ear
![fig 10.15](../static/BIOL373/fig10.15.png)
* Sound waves hit the tympanic membrane
* Malleus, incus, stapes translate the sound and amplifies it
* Cochlea has endolymph that surrounds hair cells
* Typanic duct and Vestibular duct both hold perilymph
* Cochlea is a closed, fluid filled system
* Pressure waves transmit through fluid filled cochlea

#### Cochlear Anatomy
* Organ of Corti holds organ of corti, which houses sensory hair cells and support cells
* Cochlear duct between vestibular dict and tectorial duct houses hair cells

#### Neural Coding for Pitch
* Sound waves trigger activity at different places
  * Hair cells bend more to different frequencies (natural harmonics)
  * Individual stimulated hair cells "code" similar to labeled line coding
  * "Place code hypothesis"
* Frequency of the sound determines frequency of the AP
  * Tonically coded
  * Known as temporal coding
  * Problem occurs when AP's cant be produced at 20kHz (refractory period)
* Current hypothesis:
  * Pitch coding is "pooled" between several neurons
  * Place coding as well as temporal coding

#### Neural Pathways for Auditory Information
![fig 10.21](../static/BIOL373/fig10.21)
* Information from one ear travels to both auditory cortices
* Information crosses at the cochlear nuclei (directional hearing)

#### Hearing Loss
* Three types of hearing loss
  * Conductive
    * Sound fails to travel through external or middle ear
  * Central
    * Damage in the neural pathway
    * Could be damage to the pathway or the cortex itself
  * Sensorineural
    * Damage to the sensory structures of the inner ear

#### Equilibrium - Vestibular Apparatus
* Two components
  * Dynamic - Movement
  * Static - Position of head
* Information is integrated with other sensory systems
  * muscular and joint proprioceptors
  * visual information
* Detected by hair cells lining fluid filled chambers
  * Otolith organs - (utricles, saccule)
    * linear acceleration and head position
  * Semicircular canals
    * rotational acceleration
![fig 10.22](../static/BIOL373/fig10.22.png)
* Blue - fluid filled canals
* Hair cells are grouped in cristae
* Otoliths are crystals that move around
  * Utricles detect forward/backwards
  * Otoliths detect up/down

#### Neural Pathways for Equilibrium
* Vestibular neurons are adaptive
* Major input to Cerebellum

#### Anatomy of the Eye
![fig 10.25](../static/BIOL373/fig10.25.png)
* light enters through pupil information exits through the optical nerve at the back
* canal of schlemm collects fluid from chamber (aqueous humor)

#### Signal Transduction
* Disk like structures are found at the interface between rods/cones and epithelium
  * allows for increased surface area
  * expresses large numbers of "rhodopsins"
![fig 10.32](../static/BIOL373/fig10.32.png)
* Protein complex mediates photon stimulus reponse
  * a complex of a GPCR and a signalling molecule retinal
  * retinal absorbs a single photon of a particular wavelength $\rightarrow$ conformation change
  * retinal is released into the epithelial cell
  * opsin activates transductin decreases cGMP, closes CNG channel
  * efflux of $K$ ions hyperpolarizes cell
  * neurotransmitter release decreases (glutamate is the NT)



#### Pupillary reflex
* Recall that simple reflex pathway:
  * Signal $\rightarrow$ receptor $\rightarrow$ input signal $\rightarrow$ integrating center $\rightarrow$ output signal $\rightarrow$ target $\rightarrow$ response
  * detected by photoreceptor cells
  * Travels by optic nerve (cranial nerve II)
  * integrating center at thalamus/brain stem.
  * oculomotor nerve (III)
  * target of (III) are the smooth muscles that control pupil dilation (circular, radial, constriction, dilation)
* Reflex is an autonomic reflex
* not a "visual" response
  * integrated *before* the visual cortex
* Pathway
  * starts at the optic nerve at the back of the eye
  * optic chasm allows for crossing (stereo sense)
  * (II) brings information to thalamic relay, then to midbrain
  * information is sent to visual cortex but the midbrain coordinates reflex
  * (III) in the middle back to eyes

#### Phototransduction
* Eyes require a way to produce potential changes from light stimuli
* two types of photoreceptors:
  * rods and cones
* photoreceptor cells are modified ganglion cells
  * mediate pupillary light reflex
  * seasonal rhythms
  * non-visual responses to light

#### Organisation of the Eye
![fig 10.29](../static/BIOL373/fig10.29.png)
* The lens focuses light to the back of the eye
* Retina is a layer of cells that covers the back of the eye
* Macula is a small pit near the center, which is where the fovea is

#### Retina
![fig 10.29](../static/BIOL373/fig10.29.png)
* Pigment epithelium at the back of the eye
* rods and cones are embedded in the epithelial cells
* bipolar cells send information to the ganglion cells
  * Signal travels back to front
  * for this reason the eye is called "inverted"
  * light hits the *back* of the eye, signal travels through layers of cells towards the center of the eye
  * horizontal cells allow for integration between cones and rods before bipolar cells
  * amacrine allow for integration between ganglion cells
* Dent in the retina is the fovea
  * reason for dent is that layers of neurons are split
  * Light reaches epithelial cells relatively less obstructed
  * allows for clearer vision at a specific spot (roughly at reading level)
  * more cones than rods
* Low convergence, low receptive fields
  * Gives higher acuity, higher resolution
  * Lower levels of stimulus so less sensitive in low light


#### Ascending
* "fine" sensations
  * Dorsal columns
  * Crosses high in the medulla
* "coarse"
  * Spinothalamic
  * Crosses through the columns

#### Descending
* "fine"
  * Limb control
  * fine motor
  * Lateral corticospinal
* "coarse"
  * Trunk muscles
  * Core muscles
  * Anterior corticospinal
Brown-Sequard hemiplegia

#### Photoreceptor Cells
* No light stimulus
  * Opsonins are not active
  * cGMP is high - holds open cation channels ($Na^+ Ca^{2+})
    * Cell is slightly depolarized ($-40mV$)
    * Releasing neurotransmitters to next cell
    * "dark current"
* light stimulus
  * light acts on GPCR $\rightarrow$ conformation change
  * Retinal cis $\rightarrow$ trans
  * Pigment bleaching
  * Activates G-protein
    * Activates enzyme (phosphodiesterase)
    * cGMP $\rightarrow$ 5' GMP
    * Close cGMP-gated channels
    * Decreases $Na/Ca$ influx, hyperpolarizes
    * Less NT (less dark current)
* Optical encoding is passed through single photoreceptor through layers of neurons
* Ganglia at the end transmits things
