### Renal Function 2
* Kidneys process ~180L of fluid, excretes ~1.5L
* In the 1.5L:
  * foreign/toxic substances
  * endrogenous waste
  * Easily excrete waste without using a transport mechanism for each new substance

#### Reabsorption
* By default, filtrate is excreted
* Specific things (solutes, water, etc) can be reabsorbed into the blood stream
* Filtrate as it enters the capsule has the same osmolarity
* Solute and water can be reclaimed by creating a gradient
![fig 19.8](../static/BIOL373/fig19.8.png)
* Pumping sodium ions via active transport:
  * Anions move through barrier
  * Water moves through barrier to balance osmolarity
  * Other permeable solutes increase in concentration since water is being absorbed

#### Crossing the Tubular Membrane
* Paracellular
  * through cell-cell junctions
  * doesn't enter cell
* epithelial transport
  * Transport proteins on apical surface of membrane cells
  * Transport mechanism depends on gradient (active/passive)
  * Most transport depends on Na gradient
* Sodium transport in epithelium
  * Sodium enters through ENaC channel (leaky, down gradient)
  * Na/K pump through other surface out of membrane cell
  * Net effect is sodium is pumped out of the tubule lumen
* Sodium linked transport
  * Glucose is pumped into the membrane cell via SGLT transporter as Na moves into the cell
  * GLUT transporter pumps glucose out of membrane cell into ICF
  * Na is still pumped out with Na/K ATPase

#### Urea
* Urea is a small, uncharged molecule that passes through membranes fairly easily
* ~40% of urea passes through the membrane and gets reabsorbed before it reaches the collecting duct, even without transporters
* Urea gradient is set up by water reabsorption, like most molecules

#### Urea is a form of nitrogenous waste
* Urea is formed from ammonia, product of metabolizing amino acids
* Metabolically speaking, urea is in a form that can be easily recycled by the body (urea cycle)
* Can be used in other metabolic pathways, so it can be reabsorbed
* Still, most of urea gets excreted (passive diffusion is slow)

#### Proteins
* Recall that proteins don't usually enter the nephron as filtrate, they are selectively blocked
* Most small (50kDa or less) proteins are still excreted via the kidneys
* Some charged proteins are still blocked, and conformation
* glycoproteins, hormones, insulin are filtered

#### Renal Handling of Proteins
* Smaller proteins enter the nephron as filtrate, and need to be reabsorbed
* proteins in filtrate can be endocytosed by the membrane cells
  * Insulin, GH, etc have no way of passing through membrane
  * broken down inside the cell
* other proteins are broken down by brush border cells and absorbed as amino acids
  * Small linear peptides that are easily metabolized

#### Renal Transport
* Since transport requires membrane proteins, they can be saturated
* Transport maximum is the fastest rate of protein transport, occurs at some plasma concentration (renal threshold)
* Excess plasma concentration past the renal threshold can only be excreted

#### Glucose Handling at the Nephron
* At higher concentration, the same fraction enters filtrate at the same concentration, so more glucose is filtered
* Reabsorption is capped at the transport max, so it is saturated
* Glucose is excreted when the concentration is past the renal threshold, as excess, unabsorbed glucose is left in the filtrate and is excreted
* Extremely high blood glucose results in glycosuria

#### Transfer of Interstitial Fluid to Plasma
* Peritubular capillaries have low hydrostatic pressure
* Pressure gradient favours reabsorption

#### Secretion
* Secretion is a way of clearing a substance from plasma
* Uses membrane transporters/receptors

#### Protein handling at Nephron (3)
* Some small proteins are secreted into the lumen of the tubules
* Endocytosed on the basolateral side
* The protein can either be pushed into the lumen or recycled and brought back as amino acids

#### Secretion of organic anions
* Uses the organic anion transporter (OAT)
* Has broad specificity, both endrogenous and exogenous
  * bile salts, dicarboxylates, cyclic nucleotides, folate, urate
  * benzoate, salicylate, saccharine, many drugs
![fig 19.12](../static/BIOL373/fig19.12.png)
* Na-K-ATPase maintains Na gradient, (low in cell, high outside)
* NaDC
  * On both sides of the membrane, concentrates dicarboxylates inside the cell
* OAT uses dicarboxylate gradient to transport OAs ICF and Dicarboxylates into tubule

#### Drug interactions of OATs
* drugs can compete with OATs
* excess drugs can slow clearance of both competitors
* Can be used to extend "drug life" in blood
* Probenecid
  * antibiotic sparing agent
  * nephrotoxicity

#### Excretion
* Look at the filtrate compared to the excreted urine:
  * Glucose, metabolites, amino acids are not excreted
  * proteins are mostly not excreted
  * Waste products are more concentrated
* Renal handling of substances is clinically important
  * GFR is important indicator of kidney function/health
  * drugs affecting renal handling is important to know

#### Clearance
* Rate of excretion of a substance
* Defined as the plasma equivalent that is completely cleared of a substance
  * e.g. if there is X g/Y mL of a substance in blood, and X g is excreted per unit time, then we say Y mL / unit time of clearance
* excretion rate/concentration in plasma
* A substance that is filtered only through the kidneys and is not reabsorbed or secreted is a good indicator of GFR
* inulin is not absorbed or secreted, all of the inulin in the filtrate is excreted, and none are added to the filtrate
* Since all of the inulin is excreted, its clearance is equal to GFR
  * if Y mL plasma equivalent is excreted, and 100% of the excreted is from filtrate, then Y mL plasma was filtered
* Creatinine is secreted in small amounts, but is not reabsorbed
  * Good estimate for GFR

#### Renal Handling with known GFR
* inulin is an example because 100% of excreted is due to filtration
* with a known GFR, amount in urine indicates renal handling
  * If amount in urine is lower than (blood concentration) * (GFR), then net reabsorption
  * If amount in urine is higher than (blood concentration) * (GFR), then net secretion

#### Renal Handling of some substances
* inulin:
  * 100% excretion
* glucose:
  * 100% absorption, 0% reabsorption
* urea:
  * about 50/50
* penicillin
  * >100% excretion, net secretion

#### Micturition (urination)
* Filtrate cannot be changed after it reaches the collecting duct
* Opening between urethra
  * Internal - smooth muscle
  * External - skeletal muscle
* CNS external closed most of the time
![fig 19.14](../static/BIOL373/fig19.14.png)
* Spinal reflex
  * two sets of neurons, one for smooth one for skeletal
  * stretch receptors
